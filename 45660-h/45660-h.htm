<p>The Rev. Robert James, the father of Frank and
Jesse, was a native of Kentucky. His parents were
quiet, respectable people, belonging to the middle
class of society. Their desire was to raise up their
children "in the nurture and admonition of the
Lord." Being themselves persons of intelligence
and culture, far above the average of their neighbors
in those days, the parents of Rev. Robert James resolved
to give him as good an education as the facilities
accessible to them would permit. Accordingly,
Robert was early placed in a neighboring school,
and made such progress as to gladden the hearts of
his parents, and call forth auguries of future distinction
from the friends and neighbors of the family.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Robert James was a moral, studious youth, much
given to reflection on subjects of a religious character.
Before he had attained his eighteenth year, he
had made an open profession of faith in the Christian
religion, and united himself with a Baptist
church, of which his parents were members. After
passing through the various grades of an academic
course, young James entered as a student of Georgetown
College, Kentucky. Resolving to follow the
profession of a minister, he commenced the study of
Theology, was licensed to preach, and began
his ministry in his twentieth year. Even then he was
regarded as a youth of decided culture and more than
ordinary ability.</p>

<p>While yet a young man, Rev. Mr. James decided
to remove to the then new State of Missouri. He
settled on a farm in Clay county, and commenced in
earnest the onerous duties of a pioneer preacher.
His labors were not unrewarded. He soon had the
satisfaction of garnering the harvest of his sowing.
A congregation was gathered and a church organized
in Clay county, called New Hope, which is still
in existence. For some years the Rev. Mr. James
ministered to the people who had been gathered by
his exertions, with great acceptance. Nor were his
labors confined to the spiritual welfare of the people
of New Hope. He visited many distant churches,
and preached with great acceptance in many places.</p>

<p>Old citizens of Clay county still entertain pleasant
recollections of the earnest, God-fearing pastor, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
went about only to do good, by cheering the despondent,
consoling the sorrowful, assisting the needy,
upholding the weak, confirming the hesitating, and
pointing the way of salvation to the penitent.
Everywhere, in that region of country, he was held
in the very highest esteem. So the years of his
early manhood passed away while he was engaged
in the commendable effort to better the condition, by
purifying the moral nature of his friends and neighbors.</p>

<p>In 1850, following in the footsteps of hundreds of
others, Rev. Robert James bade adieu to his family,
friends and neighbors, and set out for "the golden
land" of California, on a prospecting tour. We do
not know what motives actuated him in making this
move, nor is it pertinent to this relation. He went
away, and was destined to return no more. Not
long after his arrival in California, whither he had
been preceded by a brother, Rev. Mr. James was
stricken by a mortal disease which terminated his
life in a short time. Far away from home, where
the tall sequoias rear their lofty branches above the
plain, on a gentle slope which catches the last beams
of the setting sun, they laid the minister to rest, in a
soil unhallowed by the dust of kinsmen, in a grave
unbedewed by the tears of loved ones left behind.</p>

<p>When yet a young man, Rev. Mr. James was united
in marriage to Miss Zerelda Cole, a native of
Scott county, Kentucky. Mrs. James is a lady of
great determination of mind, and a masculine force
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
of character. Those who knew the couple in the
old days seem to think that the minister and his wife
were an ill-assorted pair. He was gentle and amiable,
while, on the contrary, his wife was strong in
passion, and of a very bitter, unrelenting temper&mdash;traits
of character prominently developed in her
sons, Frank and Jesse. It is said that the home-life
of the minister was not as smooth as it might have
been, had he been united with a companion of a less
passionate and exacting temper. With his domestic
life, however, we have nothing to do, except in so far
as the home influences thrown around his children
gave direction to their character, and tinged their
mental disposition. Whatever home-cares he might
have had, the public has little cause to inquire now.
He went down to death with a stainless name long
years before his sons entered upon a career of crime,
and made their names a terror to those who care to
obey the dictates of justice, love and mercy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Zerelda James was left a widow, having the
responsible charge of a family of four small children.
She was not left unprovided for, as Mr. James was a
prudent, careful man of business, and had already
established a comfortable home. With that courage
and determination which is so prominently manifested
in her character, Mrs. James commenced the battle
of life as the head of the family. With all the
favoring circumstances, the task assumed by her was
not a light one. But she was equal to the performance
of any required service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
The years went by, and Frank and Jesse and their
sisters were advancing toward manhood and womanhood.
The mother was not neglectful of their mental
training, and the children were very regular in
their attendance at a neighboring district school.</p>

<p>So passed away six years of Mrs. Zerelda James'
widowhood, and life became lonely; the children
were growing up, and her cares and responsibilities
seemed to increase as they advanced in age and
stature. Though not of a romantic disposition, the
widow James was yet young enough in years and
comely enough in person to attract to her side more
than one substantial citizen on matrimony intent.</p>

<p>Among the number of those who sought to produce
a favorable impression on the widow's susceptible
heart, was Dr. Reuben Samuels, who, like herself,
was a native of Kentucky. To him she was
not indifferent. She listened to his plea, and in 1857
they were united in marriage, near Kearney, Clay
county, Missouri. Dr. Samuels at once undertook to
perform the duty of a parent toward her children.</p>

<p>Thus the career of the noted outlaws, the James
Boys, was commenced, under auspices fully as favorable
as fell to the fortune of any of the boys of their
own age, in their country home. And so the years
rolled on, and the boys were approaching the estate
of manhood; while fate was shaping them to perform
a part in those troublous times, of which they dreamed
not in the days of boyhood.</p>

<p>One of the sisters of Frank and Jesse died just as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
she was approaching the estate of womanhood. She
is represented as having been a beautiful and amiable
child, who was called away from the world while
life was still beautiful and all the promises of the
future bright. Miss Susan James was arrested
with her mother in the early part of the war and
confined in the jail at St. Joseph for several months.
Afterward she went to Nebraska and remained there
for more than a year. She married a gentleman
named Parmer, several years ago, and with her
husband, resided for a time in Sherman, Texas.
From that place she removed to Henriette, and
was living there in 1879.</p>

<p>Mrs. Samuels had an eight year old son killed in
January, 1875, when the detectives attacked the
Samuels' house. A daughter, a half sister of Frank
and Jesse, remains unmarried, and resides with Dr.
and Mrs. Samuels.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i5h">              "There will be storms</div>
<div class="line">In causeless, strange abuse, and the strong breath</div>
<div class="line">Of busy mouths will blow upon our course."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Of prophecy, many have a doubt. And yet there
are prophecies from simple lips, and warnings from
babes and sucklings, which if we could but interpret
aright, might assist us to change the whole currents
of life in a fellow being.</p>

<p>Deeper than fear or doubting men are thrown into
the great vortex of the world's thought and actions.
What fortune or fate shall come to them, no one can
tell. Every billow in that maelstrom seeks its own
wild independence; and the shores of that tumultuous
deep&mdash;which we call human society&mdash;are
strewn along with the dull wrecks of what were once
glorious schemes&mdash;the bright day dreams&mdash;once
borne buoyantly upon the topmost waves. These,
and myriads of other schemes and hopes, are at last
remanded to lie under the dark waters of the Sea of
Fate, hidden so completely that no thought of man
shall ever again recall them to memory.</p>

<p>It is perhaps best so. It would be equivalent to
the expulsion of all the joys of life to have opened
before us the book of the future, wherein is recorded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
the deeds which must be performed, and the sorrows
which shall fall, dark and impenetrable&mdash;extinguishing
every scintillation of joyous hope.</p>

<p>It was best for Robert James, the minister, that
he was called home before the shadows fell, before
the prophet's voice gave warning of the things which
should come to pass. It was well he was spared
the revelation, so that when the summons came, in
peace he drew around him the drapery of his couch,
and while the brilliant sun of an undimmed faith
shone full upon him, he laid aside the load of life,
and went into the presence of the Deity, satisfied
with a career which had more of love toward mankind
than displeasure at the conduct of the world.</p>

<p>When their father was laid away in a far-off
grave, Frank was but a "wee boy," and Jesse still
an infant. From him they had received few lessons
to guide them through the thorny ways of life.
Their widowed mother became their counsellor and
teacher. From her they had inherited their most
pronounced traits of character&mdash;strong-willed, courageous,
self-assertive, and unrelenting toward those
who had given cause of offense.</p>

<p>Those who knew them during the days of their
childhood and youth, differ widely in opinion concerning
the character of the promise they gave of
their future course in life. Some say they were
"nice, well behaved boys," others that "they were
about like other boys," and yet another class say
that they were "bad boys, very bad boys from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
beginning." There is no doubt that they were sometimes
"a little wild," as their best friends admit. We
have accounts of some of their childish actions
which indicate that even in early life they manifested
a decided inclination to be malicious, not to say
heartless and cruel.</p>

<p>The step-father of the boys seems to be a man of
amiable disposition, and his government over the
children was far from being after the order of the
traditional step-father. The consequence was Frank
and Jesse advanced to the years of maturity without
any of those healthful, restraining influences
which moralists assure us are essential to the proper
development of the higher qualities of manhood.
Be that as it may, we have been assured by persons
of the highest respectability, who were acquainted
with them long before the commencement of the
war between the States, that "they were their own
masters" at a very early age, save only when their
strong-willed mother asserted her prerogative to
dominate over them, which, by the way, she seldom
did. Among the boys of the neighborhood they
were not without friends. But among them, they
were leaders. Aside from a willingness on the part
of other boys to accept such leadership, the Jameses
were exceedingly disagreeable, and generally attempted
to enforce a due recognition of their
superiority. Such were the great outlaws as boys.</p>

<p>It is related of them, that when Frank was thirteen,
and Jesse eleven years of age respectively,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
they met a boy with whom at some previous time
they had engaged in a childish wrangle. The lad
who had incurred their ill-will was thirteen years old,
well developed, and possessed of courage and determination.
But he was not able to engage successfully
in a contest with the brothers. It was in the
spring time. The streams were full and deep. The
boys met in a large forest. The Jameses attacked
their neighbor, and succeeded in administering to
him a severe beating. Not content with this, they
procured thongs of tough bark, bound their victim
securely and threw him into a deep pool in a neighboring
stream. Several times was this ducking process
repeated, to the great terror of the boy, and the
infinite satisfaction of his tormentors. After satiating
their vengeance in this way, until thoroughly
wearied, the young tyrants drew him out and tied
him securely to a tree in the midst of the gloomy
forest. It was in the morning when they left him
there, and he was not released until nearly dusk,
when a neighbor, who was out in pursuit of squirrels,
heard his cries and went to his assistance. The boy
had suffered so much, that he was thrown into a
fever, from which he did not recover in many weeks.
These tyrant boys were the predecessors of the
guerrillas and the outlaws.</p>

<p>It was an early ambition of Frank and Jesse to
have and use fire-arms. Dr. Samuels presented each
of them with a small double-barrel shot-gun, and the
accompanying accoutrements of the sportsman. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
day the gift was received was a proud and happy
one to the boys. They soon learned to use them,
and in a brief time they were expert shots, and many
feathered songsters ceased to sing forever before
their unerring aim. Rabbits, squirrels and other
small game were their prey.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_021.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>In the Woods with their new Shot-Guns.</p>
</div></div>

<p>But shot-guns lost their novelty after awhile, and
they yearned for pistols. They had read or heard of
the skill of the adventurers away out on the borders,
and they dreamed of rivaling them some day. At
last by dint of self-denial and persistent saving,
Frank and Jesse were made glad by an opportunity
which was offered to procure pistols, on the occasion
of a visit to St. Joseph, which they were permitted
to make in company with Dr. and Mrs. Samuels.</p>

<p>We may safely conclude that the pistols were not
of the pattern which the outlaws of the present day
most esteem. But they had pistols, and the neighbors
in the vicinity of the Samuels' residence very
speedily became painfully aware of the fact, by the
perpetual reports of their weapons while they were
out "at practice," which was nearly every hour of
daylight. This constant practice gave them proficiency
in the use of such weapons, and long before
they had arrived at manhood's estate they were masters
of the art of pistol shooting.</p>

<p>They became noted throughout the neighborhood
for their skill. So accurate had become their aim
that they would measure a distance of fifteen paces
from a tree standing in an open space, and commence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
walking around it, firing glancing shots as they
walked, and so continuing until they had completely
girdled the tree. Later in life they acquired such
skill that they would ride at a full gallop around a
circle, with a tree in its center, at a distance of seventy-five
paces, firing as they rode, and entirely girdle
the tree with revolver bullets, never losing a single
shot. Thus Frank and Jesse had become masters
of an art which rendered them dangerous foes
when the days of turmoil came.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>So the years passed away, and the lads had already
grown to be tall and shapely, when the tocsin
of civil war rang throughout the land. They were
not then old enough to enter at once upon the duties
incumbent upon soldiers. But they were growing
apace, and the days of strife and bloodshed were
not destined to pass away ere they grew strong
enough to ride with the strongest, and bold enough
to face danger with the most daring.</p>

<p>We may well suppose that all their dreams at that
momentous period were of war, bloodshed, and all
the concomitant horrors of warfare. The shadow
of Destiny had fallen athwart their pathway when
the first gun was fired&mdash;the pandemonium of passion,
still dormant in their breasts, was ready to be kindled
in all its baleful fury.</p>

<div class="line">Chilling forever."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>At last the war-cloud, which had been hovering
for months over our fair land, burst with a fury that
was appalling. Cheeks were blanched and hearts
were made tremulous in agony. Missouri was destined
to realize a season of despair, such as has fallen
upon few people in modern times. It was neighbor
against neighbor, kinsman against kinsman, brother
against brother, and vengeful hate burning up all
that was merciful and good in human nature. The
night of woe had descended.</p>

<p>The appearance of the renowned Guerrilla chieftain,
Quantrell, on the border; the stories which
were circulated concerning his achievements; the
feverish state of the public mind, and the circumstances
in which the people of this State were involved,
all contributed to exert a large influence
over the minds of the youths and young men just
coming upon the stage of life in the Western counties.
Cole Younger, who had not then been regarded
as "a wild lad," equally with Frank James,
who had been so regarded, was attracted to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
standard of the daring Guerrilla. In the vortex of
passion which whirled through the land, all principles,
love, justice, mercy and hope were swallowed up.
Men were transformed by the baleful influence.</p>

<p>Previous to the departure of Frank James for
Quantrell's camp, there is no evidence that Dr. or
Mrs. Samuels had been mistreated or in any way insulted
by the Federal militia. The Samuels family
were intensely attached to the Southern cause, and
the very appearance of soldiers in the blue uniform
of the United States was not a little galling to the
sectional pride and native passion of Mrs. Samuels,
who did not hesitate at any time to abuse the cause
which they represented. In this pleasant pastime
she was always emphatic and unamiable in expression.</p>

<p>It was early in 1862 that Frank James bid adieu
to all peaceful pursuits, and rode away in the dim
twilight hour to seek the camp of the Guerrilla Chieftain.
He had made a start toward becoming an
outlaw. It was in the spring-time. Frank was away
with Quantrell's reckless band, and Jesse, who had
attained the age of sixteen years, was ploughing in
a field on the Samuels estate, near Kearney, when
on a bright day a band of Federal militia approached
the homestead. They first encountered Dr. Samuels,
and him they laid violent hands upon, bore him
away to a convenient tree, adjusted a rope about his
neck and hanged him to a projecting branch until
life was almost extinct, and so they left him for others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
to relieve. Not content with this exhibition of
prowess, the valiant warriors proceeded to the field
where Jesse followed his plough, and laid hold upon
him, and placed a rope around his neck and told him
his hour had come, and while they tormented him in
this manner, some of them pricked his body with
their bayonet-points or their sabres. The reason assigned
by the militiamen for this exhibition of violence,
was that Jesse James was accustomed to ride
fast and far when the shades of night fell upon the
earth, to convey intelligence to the Guerrilla Chieftain
of the movements of the militia. When they
had chastised him, and warned him that if he rode
any more to carry the news they would kill him,
they let him go his way.</p>

<p>But Jesse James was not to be intimidated. He
rode again and again to the hidden camp. His bad
passions were aroused. The boy had become a savage.
That same week the militia made a descent upon
the farm-house of Dr. Samuels, and finding Mrs. Samuels
and her daughter, Miss Susie James, at home,
they were placed under arrest and conveyed to the
jail at St. Joseph, at that time a place reeking in
filth, where they were detained for a number of
weeks, all the while subjected to the coarse jests and
cruel jeers of the unfeeling guards. This last act
on the part of the Federal militia determined the future
course of Jesse James. While his mother and
sister languished in jail, Jesse mounted a horse, fleet
of foot, and rode away, nor did he stop until he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
drew rein in Quantrell's camp. At this time he was
described as not yet sixteen years of age, with a
smooth, handsome face, with deep blue eyes, and a
complexion as soft, as delicate and fair as a school
girl's. But even then the bright blue eyes were never
at rest, and about the mouth were the lines of strong
determination, and a certain expression of countenance
that indicated cool courage. He, perhaps, had
the susceptibility of being merciful, but <em>his mercy</em> was
a mere whim&mdash;a passing fancy and not a quality.</p>

<p>Frank and Jesse had both entered upon their career&mdash;a
course in life destined to blight all that was
noble, or susceptible of becoming noble and grand
in character. The old life, with all its promise, and
all its dreams and hopes, was past. Henceforth a
new life, fraught with danger and sufferings, and
crimes which should make their very names a terror,
was to animate them. The hard lines were drawn,
and the men who might have served well the interests
of a peaceful society, had more favorable circumstances
surrounded them, cast loose all the restraints
of civilized life, and in a day, as it were, returned
to that condition of savage existence from
which the race had been raised by ages of struggle.
They were not long in proving to their comrades
that they were worthy to be numbered among their
desperate ranks. Their efficiency as daring and
dangerous partisans was soon made manifest.</p>

<div class="line">"The presence of soldiers is a wicked thing,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Bounded in time and circumscribed in space."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The presence of armed men wearing the blue uniform
of the Federal army in the counties of Platte,
Clinton and Clay, Missouri, was commingled gall
and worm-wood to the souls of that portion of the
population which was devoted to the Southern
cause. These constituted probably more than two-thirds
of the inhabitants. The passions of the people
on both sides were at a white heat. Neighbor
was contending with neighbor, and friends were ready
to strike down the friends who opposed, and old associates
divided by politics, had become the bitterest
of foes. Anarchy prevailed. Society was rent into
fragments and the law of hate was triumphant.</p>

<p>Frank and Jesse James were with Quantrell's
band, and were selected to go on an expedition
with a scout under Captain Scott, to the north side
of the Missouri river. The town of Richfield was
garrisoned by a company of some thirty men under
command of a Captain Sessions, of the Federal
State militia. Scott's command consisted of only
twelve. Yet with this feeble force he determined to
attack Richfield. Frank James was one of the men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
appointed to lead the attacking party. A desperate
fight ensued. Captain Sessions and Lieut. Graffenstien,
of the Federal garrison, were killed at the first
fire. The Guerrillas gained a complete triumph.
Ten of the militiamen were killed, while Scott did
not lose a man. The survivors of the fray surrendered
to the partisan, Captain Scott, and he paroled
them.</p>

<p>After the morning fight, Scott moved about twenty
miles that day to the house of one Pat McGinnis, in
Clay county. It was made the duty of Frank James
to scout through the country that night, and he rode
away from the camp of the partisan in the black night&mdash;rode
straightway to the home of his mother. That
lady was at home. She had been collecting information
for the use of the Guerrillas, and was pleased to
see her son. To him she opened her budget of intelligence.
The movement of Scott on Richfield had
startled the Federal militia. The small bands were
rapidly concentrating, and were strengthening their
position every day. Plattsburg, the county seat of
Clinton, had been stripped of its garrison, which had
been sent out to hunt for the bold raiders, and was at
that very time defenseless. Such was the character
of the information gathered by Mrs. Samuels, and imparted
to her son, who, in company with a comrade,
Mr. Fletcher Taylor, rode hastily back to Scott's
camp to report the character of the information
which he had gained.</p>
<div class="figcenter">

<img class="mw" src="images/i_031.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>A Moonlight Conference.</p>
</div></div>

<p>On receiving the information, Scott resolved to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
make an attempt upon Plattsburg. During the succeeding
day it was ascertained that Captain Rodgers
had left Plattsburg to make an effort to discover and
capture Scott, taking with him most of the garrison.
In the first watch of the second night after the affair
at Richfield, Scott's little band silently deserted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
their camp and rode rapidly toward Plattsburg.
Two o'clock in the morning found them within four
miles of that place, on Smith's fork of Grand river.
Here they halted and slept until daylight. They
were in a deep forest, and quite secure from observation.
Until three o'clock in the evening they remained
quiet, feeding their horses and resting. Then
the scouts brought intelligence concerning the situation
at the town, and the Guerrillas, mounting, set out
to capture it. There were a few men left as a guard
at the Court-house, under the command of a Lieutenant.
The officer had been out in town when the
Guerrillas charged into the public square. Before he
could rejoin his men he was cut off by Frank James,
to whom he was compelled to yield himself a prisoner.
James at once conducted his captive into the
presence of Captain Scott. The militia in the
Court-house, though taken by surprise, were not disposed
to yield without a struggle. At the time the
Lieutenant was brought before Scott, they were
pouring a severe fire among the Guerrillas, and the
issue was in doubt. Pointing to his prisoner, Frank
said, "Captain, shoot that man, unless he delivers
up the Court-house." "That I will!" responded
Scott, with a terrible oath as he drew his pistol. The
officer besought his men to yield, which under the
circumstances they consented to do.</p>

<p>Two hundred muskets were captured and destroyed,
and $12,000 in "Union Defence Warrants," of
the State of Missouri, were seized and appropriated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
The spoils of victory were divided among the band.
Frank's share was $1,000. It was his first taste of
gain through violent appropriation&mdash;an initiative lesson,
so to speak. He has become a proficient since
that time. The raiders, whose camps were usually to
be found in forests, far away from the generally traveled
highways, concluded to sup like civilized men that
night, hence they ordered supper at the hotel, and
had for their guest the late Federal commander of
the post.</p>

<p>Frank James is a silent man, having little to say,
and that little is brought out in sharp, short sentences.
He is not so tall as Jesse, nor so robust in
form. He never laughs, and was never known to
jest with his comrades. In the early days of the war
he was beardless, and the outlines of his features
were visible to all. His face is long, with a broad,
square forehead, and a strong under jaw and heavy
chin. His eyes are dark gray and are restless, and
always have a wicked expression about them. In
later years Frank James wears a full beard, and on
that account is not so readily recognizable by those
who knew him in the old days.</p>

<p>Jesse James, as a youth, had a round jovial face,
and rather a pleasant expression of countenance.
He was then the reverse of taciturn; had a merry
laugh, and was "a fellow of infinite jest" among his
comrades. In all his subsequent career he has been
the Aaron to Frank. Jesse always does the talking
yet, when they have occasion to communicate with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
strangers. In later years Jesse, too, has become reserved,
not so taciturn as his brother, but still more
silent than the average of men. Neither one of the
brothers is given to boisterous merriment now-a-days,
since life's shadows have fallen so darkly
around them.</p>

<div class="line i2h">    Black with the night-tide where is none to hear</div>
<div class="line">The ancient cry, the wherefore of our days."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The years come and go, and they give birth to
bright and tender dreams, as well as to passions dark
as Azrael's wing, and fierce as flames of Tophet.
Yes, the years give joy and peace to some, and hope
buds, as in the spring days the lilacs bloom. Yet
time digs deep graves in which to bury our fondest
hopes, and obliterates in indistinguishable night
every earthly joy. It is better so. If we could draw
aside the screen which hides from our ken the things
of the future, who of us would enjoy the prospect?</p>

<p>There was a time, perhaps, when Frank and Jesse
James would shudder at the thought that they should
become not only soldier-slayers of men, but robbers
and murderers as well. And yet they were drifting
down a rapid tide toward the great black gulf of
evil. A few months calls the leaves from their
buds, and dresses the forest in green&mdash;a few months
more and the leaves and flowers wither before the
North wind's breath and the beautiful flowers and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
the gay leaves become loathesome in the dust of
decay.</p>

<p>And so too, we imagine, are the changes of mind
and the transformation of character. The James
boys were in a school where the gentle law of mercy
was never imparted; in a school where the instructors
were incarnations of bitterness and hate, and
every pupil devoted to the lessons they gave out.
So the months rolled away and it was not long before
they could listen unmoved to the last sigh of
the dying victim, and send a foe before the aim of
their unerring bullets, to challenge the sentinels on
the farther shore of the river of death without a
thought or tremor of remorse. They were fit now
to take part in the most sanguinary warfare ever waged
in this country&mdash;the Guerrilla warfare along the border
of Missouri.</p>

<p>It was therefore without any twinges of conscience
that they heard the proposition of the revengeful
Quantrell, to capture and sack the city of Lawrence
and massacre its male inhabitants. They were in
the transforming stage, the full grown desperadoes
were just coming along the steps of time from the
closet of the future.</p>

<p>It was a night in August&mdash;the 16th&mdash;1863, when the
commander of the fiercest band of Guerrillas that
ever marauded in the State of Missouri, gave the
order, "Saddle up, men!" in his camp on the
Blackwater, and unfurling that ominous black banner
with the single relief of the word "Quantrell"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
in white, the bush-warriors rode west toward the
Kansas border, intent upon a mission which could
neither succeed nor suffer repulse without bringing
sorrow to many hearts. On the way three peaceable
citizens beyond the Aubrey, were pressed into
service as guides to the bloody band. They forced
these to lead them until they had reached a part of
the country where their knowledge extended no
further, and when they came to a grove of timber on
the margin of a stream, the three poor inoffensive
men were remorsely shot, Frank James being one of
the executioners. They had set out to kill all Kansas
men.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<p>After Lawrence.</p>
</div></div>

<p>On the morning of the 21st, it was as clear and
bright a summer morning as ever gladdened the
earth. Quantrell's band was in full view of the ill-fated
city. There was a charge, women's faces
blanched, and shrieks rent the air. Volley after
volley broke the stillness of the morning. The people
saw the sombre black flag, and knew that the Guerrillas
were upon them. On they came, a resistless
tide. Men sank down without a groan. The very
streets ran red in human blood. Women and children,
coming before the fatal revolver bullets which
streamed along the street, met their fate as they fled
for the shelter of homes that were destined for the
flames to feed upon. In this pandemonium of war-fiends,
Frank and Jesse James were conspicuous actors.
Here, there, everywhere, when opportunity
offered, men either armed or unarmed and defenseless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
were made victims of their skill as pistol shooters, and
they felt no more regret than if they had been acting
the part of honorable soldiers and chevaliers.
The torch was applied, and the terrors of billowy
flames were added to the horrors of the scene. How
many houses they burned, and how many lives they
destroyed that day, they themselves do not know;
of the first there were several, of the second there
were many.</p>

<p>They returned with Quantrell to Missouri. They
had learned well. The lads who are claimed by
their friends to have been gentle as cooing doves in
the home nest had been singularly transformed into
merciless eagles, or vindictive kites, rather. They
had proved that human rights and human lives had
little to call for their regard, and so the first stage of
a notorious career had been attained by these
brothers ere yet they had reached their majority.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The cruel strife of the border can never be forgotten.
Those were tragic days, the very remembrance
of which comes like a dream of sorrow and desolation
of soul. It is well that such terrible times have
passed away, for to those who were exposed to the
fury of that tidal-wave of passion, which swept over
the fair borderland, physical existence must have
been a wheel of pain. But the mighty procession of
the ages, sweeping by, will soon obliterate the traces
of the storm's ravages, and only the dim legends of
horrible deeds will remain.</p>

<p>In that dreadful ebullition of human hatreds,
Frank and Jesse James played no laggard's part.
As boys, they accepted service under Quantrell, and
became renowned for caution and daring even in the
days of their youth. Members of a partisan organization,
famed even in the early days of the strife
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
for daring deeds and extraordinary activity; a band,
every man of which was a desperado of great cunning
and prowess, these two callow-youths, taken
from a country farm, speedily rose to the eminence
of leading spirits among the most daring of men.
Both sides in the border counties of Missouri and
Kansas prosecuted war with a vindictive fury unparalleled
in modern history. The scene of the operations
of the Guerrillas was at first confined to the
limits of Clay, Platte, Jackson, Bates, Henry, Johnson,
and Lafayette counties, in Missouri, and along
the Kansas border.</p>

<p>These men rode far and fast in the night time, and
fought their foes at early dawn. Living in out-of-the-way
neighborhoods were their friends. When
pressed hard they disbanded and scattered, and rendered
all pursuit futile.</p>

<p>Frank and Jesse James early discovered those
traits of character which have rendered them famous
as the greatest outlaws and freebooters of modern
times. They became scouts and spies for Quantrell
at the beginning of their career, and showed themselves
possessors of remarkable capacity for such
service. They were cool and brave, fertile in resources,
and marvelous in cunning.</p>

<p>After Lawrence came the disbandment, and with
the disbandment came that strange training in individual
development and personal reliance which
have made the Boys objects of fear to the people of
many regions, and enabled them to plunder at will,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
baffle pursuit, and defy the civil authorities of great
States.</p>

<p>They had hiding places with friends in Clay,
Platte, Jackson, Johnson, Cass and Lafayette counties,
and when the Guerrilla band to which they belonged
scattered in order to evade pursuers, the Boys
retired to the dwellings of their friends and rested in
peace till the time of re-organizing, when an enemy
was to be punished.</p>

<p>Perhaps no two individuals ever lived on this continent
who have taken so many lives, as the James
Boys. Emerging from the seclusion which they
could always find in the Hudspeth neighborhood, in
the eastern part of Jackson county, in July, 1863, with
Captain George Todd, a redoubtable Guerrilla chieftain,
with whose command Frank and Jesse often
fought, they struck the road leading from Pleasant
Hill to Blue Springs. Major Ransom, a Federal
officer with a cavalry force, was traveling that road
at the time. A collision took place. The fighting
was savage. The volleys of revolver bullets fired by
the Guerrillas proved awfully destructive to their opponents.
Jesse and Frank James have been credited
with a tremendous destruction of life&mdash;Jesse killing
seven, and, Frank eight men in the Federal ranks
during that encounter.</p>

<p>One night Frank James and five or six of his comrades
were detailed to capture and kill the militia
men who were accustomed to frequent a bagnio, four
miles east of Wellington, in Lafayette county.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Frank James preceded the little band, and, creeping
up under the window, he saw the company inside.
There were eleven men in dalliance with the women.
James returned to his comrades, reported the result
of his observations, and the Guerrillas rode to the
house. A peremptory summons brought the militiamen
to the yard. The Guerrillas poured a volley of
bullets among them. The ten men fell, pierced by
the deadly missiles. But where was the eleventh
man? There had been that number in the house
when James saw the company, and the man could
not have left the place. A search was instituted.
The man could not be found. But there was one
woman more in the party than had been seen before.
A candle was procured and a search instituted
among them. They all appeared to be women.
Frank James discovered the man. He was a youth,
fair skinned and blue eyed, with long brown hair.
His features were handsome, and in the garments of
a woman he appeared not unlike a fresh country
girl. Of course he expected to die there. His ten
companions presented the spectacle of a ghastly
wreck of humanity in the yard as they lay there
cold in death. But he plead for his life. He was so
young to die. "Here, Frank, take him," said the
leader. "You discovered him; he is yours to deal
with." It was a sentence of death, they said. The
boy thought so, and hope vanished. "Come," said
Frank, "come along and be shot." The poor youth
trembled in every nerve. He could scarcely walk.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
His supposed executioner had to assist him down
the steps and out through the yard. They passed
the ghastly heap of corpses, lying there in the dim
starlight. They went away, into the darkness under
the sombre trees, down the road. Poor boy, he
thought of his mother. Under the wide-spreading
branches of an ancient oak they halted. "Here!
we are far enough," said Frank James. The poor
youth almost fell to the earth from excess of emotion.
To die, and so young, and in such a way, too!
"Oh, spare me for the sake of my mother!" he
wailed. "You are free to go! I give you your life.
You are outside of the pickets, outside of danger.
Go, and be quick about it!" And at that moment
Frank James fired a pistol shot upward through the
branches of the oak, and the fair haired boy soldier
disappeared in the darkness&mdash;spared for the sake of
his mother by the youthful desperado. Frank James
returned to his comrades. They had heard the shot
and naturally concluded that it meant one more life
ended. Frank assumed a grave expression. "Quick
work," remarked a comrade. "Yes," returned the
Guerrilla, "babies and boys are not hard to kill."
He never spoke of that better deed he performed
out there, with only the stars and God as witnesses.</p>

<p>A Deed of Mercy.</p>
</div></div>

<p>And the border strife went on. Frank and Jesse
rode with Quantrell, sometimes with Todd and
Poole, then again they fought at unexpected times
by the side of John Jarrette, and Bill Anderson, and
Arch Clements. One week they would be charging
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Blunt's Body Guard in Southeastern Kansas; the
next they would ambush a moving column of Federal
militia in Lafayette, or Jackson county, Missouri.
It was fighting&mdash;cruel, savage fighting, all the while.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
In the bottom lands along the Blue, or among the
Sni hills, when hotly pursued, they would find hiding
places, from whence they emerged only to deal out
destruction and death. Down to Texas, marching
with the close of autumn, like migratory birds, they
returned to their old haunts with the bright spring
days. Deceiving and cutting to pieces Lieut. Nash's
small command in the road west of Warrensburg, on
a Monday, we hear of their successfully ambushing a
column of Union militia on the banks of the Little
Blue on the succeeding Wednesday, and a few days
afterwards we hear of Frank and Jesse playing "the
trumps" of revolver bullets among a squad of rollicking
soldier gamesters at Camden; then again
they are heard of with Todd, riding down
the road from Independence toward Harrisonville,
where, seven miles from the former place,
they encounter Captain Wagner, of the Second
Colorado Cavalry, and engage in a terrible hand-to-hand
conflict in which Jesse James takes the
life of the Captain, and with his deadly aim
sends seven of Wagner's men to the bourne of the
dead. On the same occasion Frank, riding furiously
among the Federal cavalrymen, deals death to eight
of them. So the spring and summer of 1864 was
passing with these men engaged in deeds of blood.</p>

<p>It was in the last days of July of 1864, that Arch
Clements and Jesse James were riding along a country
road one evening, when they discovered four
militiamen in an orchard gathering apples. Two of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
the men were in one tree and two in another. Without
ceremony the Guerrillas shot them as they would
have shot squirrels from a forest tree, and jested of
the deed as they might have jested over the fall of
wild beasts.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Frank James had a
thrilling adventure. He had been ordered out on a
scout to ascertain the movements of the Federals in
Jackson and Cass counties. It was a period of deep
anxiety to the Guerrilla leaders, as it appeared that
special efforts were being made by the Federal militia,
and several companies of the Second Colorado
Cavalry, to capture all the irregular Confederates
found in the State of Missouri. Frank had reached
the Independence and Harrisonville road at a point
about midway between the two towns. As he passed
through the country he ascertained that a force of
infantry and cavalry were at a house some miles
away from the road. How many there were in this
detachment he could not learn. But he resolved to
investigate. Taking a neighborhood path, not much
traveled, he rode toward the Federal encampment.
On the roadside was a lonely cabin, now uninhabited,
as he believed. He examined the indications,
and rode on. At the cabin the road made a short
turn. When Frank turned around the corner of the
old cabin, two militiamen presented their muskets
and commanded him to halt. In an instant the ready
pistol was snatched from its place by the Guerrilla,
and even before the militiaman could fire, the bullet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
from Frank's pistol had penetrated his brain, and he
fell in the agonies of death to the earth. At the
very instant of firing, Frank put spurs to his horse
and galloped away, turning and firing at the remaining
guard as he did so, and wounding him unto death
just as he was in the act of firing at the daring rider.
The bullet from the militiaman's gun whistled within
an inch of Frank James' ear as it sped on its harmless
mission. The picket post where the firing took
place was within a few hundred yards of a camp
where a hundred militiamen, and half that number
of cavalrymen, who rode good horses, were taking
their dinners. Frank, surmising that the two soldiers
with whom he had the combat were on guard duty
close to camp, and that an alarm and pursuit would
follow, rode with all speed toward the Guerrilla
camp. He was pursued, as he expected, but he
easily eluded the Coloradoans.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>A Narrow Escape.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In August&mdash;it was the 12th day of that month,
1864, that Jesse and Frank participated with their
comrades, Todd, Anderson and others, in a desperate
conflict in Ray county, Missouri. Again the
deadly revolvers, in the hands of the boys, accomplished
fatal results. Between the two, seven fellow-beings
were sent to the silent realms of death.</p>

<p>Two days afterward they were at the Flat Rock
Ford, on Grand river, and a desperate struggle with
some Federal militia and volunteers ensued. During
that fight Jesse was struck by a musket ball which
tore through his breast, cut into and through his left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
lung, and caused him to fall. His comrades carried
him away. At length he was transported to the
house of Captain John A. M. Rudd. The wound
was a dangerous one, and all expected it would prove
fatal. Jesse believed so himself, and took from his
finger a ring which he charged his friends to carry to
his sister, Miss Susie James, and give her also his
dying message, which was, "I have no regret. I've
done what I thought was right. I die contented."
This event occurred August 16th, 1864. By the 7th
of September he had so far recovered as to be able
to ride and fight again.</p>

<p>On the 12th of September Jesse and Frank rode
away with Lieutenant George Shepherd, from the
Guerrilla rendezvous at Judge Gray's, near Bone
Hill, Jackson county, for a raid into Clay county.
At this time he visited his mother. On the 16th of
September Jesse James killed three militiamen in an
encounter near Keytesville, Chariton county, Missouri.
He was now so far recovered as to perform
the services of a scout.</p>

<p>On the 17th he rode twenty-nine miles in the
night time, through a country swarming with militia,
to advise Todd concerning the movements of the
Federal forces.</p>

<p>On the 20th of September, 1864, occurred the
battle of Fayette, Missouri. The whole of Quantrell's
band was concentrated for the purpose of
making this attack. All the chieftains were present,
Quantrell and Anderson, Poole and Clements. During
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
the assault on the stockade, Lee McMurtry was
desperately wounded close up to the enemy's position.
Jesse and McMurtry were comrades, and he
would not allow his friend to fall into the hands of
the Federals if he could help it. He rushed up to
where the wounded man lay, and though exposed to
a terrible fire, he carried away his wounded friend
without receiving any injury. The Guerrillas were
driven from Fayette.</p>

<p>At this time the various bands seemed to accept the
leadership of Bill Anderson, who was then gathering
forces for the Centralia expedition. Quantrell separated
from him, and returned to a secure place of
repose in Howard county.</p>

<p>Todd and Poole and the James boys, Pringle, the
scalper, the two Hills and Clements, indeed, all of
the most desperate of the Guerrilla gang followed
the black banner of the most savage Guerrilla that
ever trod the soil of Missouri.</p>

<p>The 27th of September, 1864, must ever be a memorable
day in the annals of the civil war in Missouri.
On that day, with a flag black as the raven's
wing, and ominous of the coming night of death,
Bill Anderson rode to Centralia, a village in the
northeastern part of Boone county, Mo., on the line
of the St. Louis, Kansas City and Northern Railroad.
He was not long idle. A train of cars drew up to
the depot. There were soldiers and citizens on that
train. Very few of the former, however, were
armed. Only a few guns, at any rate, were fired. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
train and its passengers were completely at the mercy
of the Guerrillas. The Federal soldiers and citizen
passengers were formed in a line. Then a separation
of citizens and soldiers took place. Twenty-eight
soldiers and four citizens who wore blue blouses
were selected, marched out and shot with an atrocious
haste that would make even the cruel Kurds
shudder. In this bloody tragedy, Frank and Jesse
James were prominent actors.</p>

<p>Scarcely had this butchery been consummated,
when Major Johnson, in command of about 100 Iowa
cavalrymen, came upon the scene. The force of the
Guerrillas under command of Todd numbered more
than two hundred men, and as both were determined,
a desperate fight ensued. But the impetuous
charge of the Guerrillas, led by George Todd, broke
the lines of the Iowans, and a panic ensued among
them. Major Johnson made gallant effort to rally his
men. It was in vain. The furious riders dashed among
them and shot them down like so many panic-stricken
sheep. Jesse James, mounted on a superb
horse, rode directly at Major Johnson. The issue
was not doubtful. The deadly aim of the Guerrilla
soon laid him stark and still on the prairie. It was
all over with him, and also for the men he commanded
that morning. Appeals for mercy were of
no avail. The vanquished Federals were massacred.
Frank James was equally active with his brother. He
is credited with having taken the lives of eight men
that day. It was a day of horror, and the partisan
rangers revelled in the carnage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
After Centralia came hard knocks. In one of the
fights immediately succeeding the Centralia holocaust,
Dick Kinney, a noted Guerrilla, received his
death wound. He was Frank James' comrade,
and he fell heir to the pistol which Kinney had
worn. On the handle of this weapon were fifty
notches, each notch signifying one. He had killed
fifty men. Frank James probably has the pistol
yet.</p>

<p>In a corner of Clay county lived an old man named
Banes. He was a staunch Union man, and blessed
the Guerrillas with the same kind of blessing that
Balak desired Balaam to bestow upon Israel. Banes
was particularly severe in his condemnation of Jesse
and Frank James. One night the boys went to
Bane's house under the guise of Colorado troopers.
The old man received them gladly, and at once unbosomed
himself freely in regard to the Guerrillas.
In the course of his remarks he animadverted on
Mrs. Samuels, the mother of the boys, in bitter
terms. He denounced her as being "the mother of
two devils, Jesse and Frank James." The boys secured
his confidence, and then a promise of immediate
assistance in hunting up the desperadoes. Banes
got his gun and pistols and saddled his horse,
mounted and rode out to his death, for when the trio
had gone about half a mile away from the house, the
pretended soldiers announced themselves as the
James boys, and gave him no space for repentance.
Two pistol shots rang out on the still night, a heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
body fell to the earth, and then the living men rode
away, leaving a cold form of mortality out under the
stars.</p>

<p>With difficulty the Guerrillas made their way to
their haunts on the Blackwater. Fighting was going
on constantly. The shadow of death was gathering
over many a bold rider of the Guerrilla band. Moving
out from their camp on the Blackwater, one day,
the Guerrillas fell into an ambuscade, and several
received wounds. Among those thus wounded was
Jesse James, who had his horse killed and received a
shot through the leg.</p>

<p>Todd was sent out to skirmish with the advance
guard of the Federal army then following the retiring
army of General Price. At every creek there
was a battle, and at every encounter there was bloodshed.
In one of these fights, when the leaves were
all falling on the brown earth, George Todd was
killed. In the night time his followers came to pay
the last tribute of respect to his remains. There
were not many who gathered there in the gloom of
the midnight to gaze for the last time on the face of
the courageous Guerrilla, but among them were Jesse
and Frank James, and they pointed their pistols
toward the cloud-veiled, teary sky, and swore to
avenge his death.</p>

<p>But the old band was broken up. Late in October,
1864, Jesse and Frank parted, the former with Shepherd
went to Texas, the latter with Quantrell to
Kentucky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
It proved to be the final dissolution of Quantrell's
once formidable force of partisans. George Todd,
the Paladine of the command, the leader who was
persistent and daring, slept quietly after the fierce
turmoil of life's battlefield had ended. John Poole,
another hard rider, desperate fighter and dauntless
leader, mouldered in a gory grave. John Jarrette
and Cole Younger had sometime before separated
from the band, and were operating in the far South
where the magnolias grow and the moss-bearded
live-oaks stand sentinels in the fever-haunted swamps.
Fernando Scott was dead. Bill Anderson had fallen
in a terrible combat while endeavoring to effect a
crossing of the Missouri river in Howard county.
As he had lived for some years, grimly fighting, so in
the last extremity when the odds were all against
him and unseen messengers of death burdened the
air with their low-hummed dirges, his life went out
while he still fought in the very shades of despair.
Kinney was dead, and many more had surrendered
life in the hot simoon of battle.</p>

<p>And what a band it had been, which was now
broken! Its deeds must ever remain a part of the
history of Missouri, and the chapter wherein the
record is made will always be read with a shudder,
and in years to come men will remember the mournful
story of devastation and death with feelings of
painful regret that human beings could so revel in
the miseries and misfortunes of whole communities.</p>

<p>To those who can calmly sit and look down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
vista of the dead years and recall without prejudice
the history of men who were authors of deeds so
notable&mdash;actions which, performed under other circumstances,
would have made heroes of deathless
fame, there must come a feeling of regret that such
men should have been the victims of a baleful destiny.</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="small">ADVENTURES IN SEPARATE FIELDS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The days of Guerrilla warfare were drawing to a
close. The retreat of Price and Shelby from Missouri
left the Federals free to operate against the
Guerrillas. The old bands were decimated. Death
had been busy in their ranks; and for the remnants
of a once formidable organization, no Confederate
army could extend over them sheltering arms. The
drama was about completed; the curtain was soon to
drop.</p>

<p>Jesse James went with Lieutenant George Shepherd
to Texas in the autumn of 1864. During the
long march through the Indian Territory, they met
with many stirring adventures. On the 22d day of
November, Shepherd's band encountered the band
of Union militia, commanded by Captain Emmett
Goss, which had acquired an unenviable name on account
of the excesses which they had committed.
Goss was coming up from a marauding trip into Arkansas,
and had reached Cabin Creek, in the Cherokee
Nation. Goss was "a fighting man," and a
fierce conflict ensued. Jesse James singled out the
commander and rode full at him, firing his pistol and
receiving the return fire of the other. The contest
was short; the steady aim of the Guerrilla secured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
him a triumph. Goss fell from his horse with one
bullet-hole through his head and another through
his heart. On this occasion there was one other to
realize the skill of Jesse James with the pistol, if indeed
he realized anything after his ineffectual plea
for life. The Rev. U. P. Gardiner, chaplain of the
Thirteenth Kansas, rode with Captain Goss' band up
from toward the South. Jesse James pursued him,
and came up with him. The chaplain told his pursuer
who he was, and plead for life. The answer he
received to this petition was a bullet through the
brain. He fell from his horse dead.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
<p>Jesse James' Escape from "Pin" Indians.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Two days afterward, Jesse and a companion were
riding over the prairie, near the bank of a stream.
For some cause the comrade of Jesse left him for a
time alone. Not far away was a skirt of heavy timber.
On a sudden, a wild shout burst from the
wood, and a party of Pin Indians&mdash;that is, Cherokees,
who were friendly to the Union, came skurrying
across the prairie, directly toward the Guerrilla.
His danger was imminent, for the Cherokees were
well armed with long range guns, which they knew
well how to use. Safety lay in retreat, and Jesse
turned to flee. He was on the open prairie, and
could not get to the timber. There was a high and
steep bank before him, and the Indians were following
close behind. He determined to leap his horse
down the precipice. It happened to be where the
water was deep, and a slight projection and growth
of brush broke the fall. The leap was successfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
made, and neither horse nor rider was badly injured.
Jesse, following down the creek, made his escape,
and soon regained Lieutenant Shepherd's camp.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_060.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>A Horrible Deed.</p>
</div></div>

<p>During the winter of 1864-5 Jesse James remained
in Texas, leading quite an inactive life. With the
spring, however, that part of the Missouri Guerrillas
which went with Shepherd, began to think of Missouri
again. In April they began the return march.
The road was beset with dangers. The Pin Indians
in the Cherokee country were extremely hostile, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
left no opportunity to strike at them unimproved.
By the time the May flowers bloomed, Jesse James
had reached Benton county, Missouri. In that
county lived a Union militiaman named Harkness,
who had made himself exceedingly obnoxious to
people of Confederate sympathies. This man was
captured by the returning Guerrillas, and Jesse
James and two comrades held him in a vice-like embrace,
while another Guerrilla, Arch. Clements, cut
his throat from ear to ear.</p>

<p>At Kingsville, Johnson county, Mo., lived an old
man named Duncan, who had belonged to the militia,
and was very cordially disliked on account of his
bad disposition toward the Southern people. Jesse
James sought him, found him, and slew him. Duncan
was a man of 55 years of age.</p>

<p>The Guerrilla career of Jesse James drew to a
close. In May, 1865, all the Confederate bands in
the State were coming into the Federal posts and
surrendering. A considerable number of those who
had come up from Texas with Arch. Clements desired
to surrender, but several refused to do so.
Among these were Jesse James. But the formality
of a surrender of the others led them all to Lexington,
Mo., under a flag of truce. There were eight
unsurrendered Guerrillas to bid a last adieu to their
old comrades. This little band had proceeded into
Johnson county, when suddenly they were met by a
band of Federal troops returning from a scouting
expedition. These fired upon the Guerrillas, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
sanguinary struggle ensued. Jesse James' horse
was killed; he was wounded in the leg and retired
into the woods pursued by the Federals. He fought
with desperation, but received, at last, a shot through
the lungs. The wound was a terrible one, but he escaped,
and dragged himself to a hiding place near
the banks of a small stream. Here, for two days
and nights, alone, consumed by a raging fever, the
wounded Guerrilla lay. Finally he crawled to a
field where a man was ploughing. This man proved
to be a friend, and took James in, cared for him, and
finally sent him to his friends. The soldier who shot
Jesse James that day was John E. Jones, Company
E., Second Wisconsin regiment of cavalry. The
Guerrilla and his antagonist afterward became acquainted,
and were warm personal friends. Jesse
James joined his mother in Nebraska, and returned
with her to Clay county, Missouri.</p>

<hr class="c30" />

<p>Quantrell gathered up a small band of his old
comrades in the Guerrilla warfare, at Wigginton's
place, five miles west of the town of Waverly, Lafayette
county. Among those who obeyed the summons
to this rendezvous was Frank James. The
Confederate armies had retreated from Missouri.
There was no longer a field in that State for the exercise
of his peculiar talents. He resolved to go
East, to Maryland, and there open up a Guerrilla
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
warfare. It was on the fourth day of December
when Quantrell and Frank James and about thirty
others of their old followers and comrades left Wigginton's
for Kentucky. On the first day of January,
1865, the dreaded Quantrell's band effected the
passage of the Mississippi river at Charlie Morris'
"Pacific Place," sixteen miles above Memphis.
Morris rendered Quantrell valuable service, although
at that time he was a frequent visitor to Memphis,
and on excellent terms with the Federal authorities
at that place. After leaving the river they marched
through Big Creek, Portersville, Covington, Tabernacle,
Brownsville, Bell's, Gadsden, Humboldt, Milan,
McKenzie, and on to Paris. Here they had
their first difficulty, and were compelled to mount in
hot haste and ride away. From Paris the Guerrillas
proceeded to Birmingham, and crossed the Tennessee
river. Their route then lay through Canton,
Cadiz, and to Hopkinsville. Near this place they
came to a house where there were twelve cavalrymen.
Nine of them fled, leaving their horses. The
three men who remained fought the whole of Quantrell's
band for many hours, until preparations were
made to burn the house, and, indeed, until the fire
was kindled. They then came out and surrendered.
Quantrell, of course, appropriated the twelve fresh
horses which were in the stable.</p>

<p>There was one Captain Frank Barnette, who commanded
a company of Kentucky militia stationed at
Hartford, Ohio county. Quantrell at that time was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
playing the role of a Federal captain. As such, he induced
Barnette to go with him on a hunt for Confederate
Guerrillas. Barnette carried with this expedition
about thirty of his men. Quantrell resolved to
assassinate them all, and a way was found to do so
during the day. Frank James was made the executioner
of Captain Barnette, and as he rode by him
when they entered a stream of water at a ford, as
the sun went down behind the western hills, Frank
James fired the fatal shot, and Barnette fell dead
from his horse, dying the clear waters of the brook
red with his blood.</p>

<p>The career of the Guerrillas was drawing to a
close in Kentucky as well as in Missouri. Quantrell,
and Mundy, and Marion were constantly hunted
by dashing cavalry officers.</p>

<p>The disguise thrown off, the Federal officers knew
that work must be done in order to stop the Guerrillas,
and they were not slow in engaging in the undertaking.
Major Bridgewater and Captain Terrell
were untiring in their pursuit of Mundy, Marion and
Quantrell. Frank James visited an uncle, and was
not with Quantrell when that chieftain fought his
last fight at Wakefield's house, near the little post
village of Smiley, Kentucky. That day Quantrell's
band was nearly annihilated. Subsequently, Henry
Porter gathered up the survivors of the once formidable
Guerrilla band, and surrendered with them at
Samuel's depot, Nelson county, Kentucky, on the
25th of July, 1865. Among those who surrendered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
was Frank James. After the surrender, Frank remained
in Kentucky because of a deed which he had
performed in Missouri about a year before. There
lived in the northeast corner of Clay county a man
named Alvas Dailey. He had made himself very
obnoxious to the James Boys, and Frank resolved to
rid the world of his presence. One night he went to
Alvas Dailey's place, and the next morning he was
found dead with two bullet holes through his head.
Frank James had assassinated him.</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="small">THE BRANDENBURG, KY., TRAGEDY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Frank James went down to Wakefield's house,
where the noted Guerrilla chieftain, Quantrell, lay
wounded unto death. Had the terrible scenes of
the hard, cruel Guerrilla warfare through which he
had passed, obliterated from the breast of Frank
James every tender emotion? It appeared not, when
he bent over the white face of the wounded chief
with its traces of suffering and anguish. He shed
tears like rain. He loved his leader, and did not
hesitate to manifest that regard. Knowing that the
hand of death was upon him, Quantrell advised his
disheartened followers to accept Henry Porter's
leadership and surrender themselves to the Federal
authorities. It might have been because their dying
commander desired it, that such men as Frank
James and his companions so readily consented to
lay down the weapons of war. At any rate, the
formal submission of the Guerrillas was made.</p>

<p>In Missouri, the terrible warfare which had been
waged had left scars wide and deep and bloody, and
they were yet recent when the banners of the contending
armies were furled. At any rate, it so appeared
to Frank James, and he did not return at
once to the State of his nativity. The part he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
played had been a conspicuous one, and, on account
of Centralia, he was on the list of the proscribed,
and when the war ended, so far as actual hostilities
were concerned, it had not ended, so far as Frank
James was interested, because he was not restored
to the peaceful pursuits which he had abandoned
when first the war cry arose in the land. He still
lingered in Kentucky.</p>

<p>The conduct of Frank James for some time after
the surrender indicated a desire on his part to become
once more a quiet, peaceable citizen. He was
extremely circumspect in behavior, and demeaned
himself in a most unobtrusive way. Such was the
promise of the new life after the years of bitter
strife in the late Guerrilla. But he was not proof
against the assaults of passion. One day the old
flame burst out anew with consuming fury. Frank
had started away from the State and stopped at the
town of Brandenburg. It was several months after
the remnants of the desperate band which Quantrell
led into Kentucky had surrendered to the Federal
authorities. But the country was still in an unsettled
condition. Bad men who had found occupation
in hovering about the verge of battle and plundering
the ghastly victims of war ere the last feeble breath
had departed from their pale lips, were now idle and
had become wandering thugs in the highways of the
land. Horse thieves and bestial monsters were to
be found prowling about in nearly every community,
and more especially in the border States. A large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
number of people, and those, too, who had served in
the Confederate, as well as those who had been soldiers
in the Union armies, looked upon the men who
had been with Quantrell, and Mundy, Magruder and
Marion, Anderson, Farris, Hickman and other noted
Guerrillas, with suspicion. Many persons looked
upon them as men of evil antecedents&mdash;as thieves.</p>

<p>Horse stealing was carried on at a lively rate all
along the border. Kansas, Missouri and Kentucky
were particularly afflicted for many months after
the surrender by the presence of these enemies of
the farming and stock-raising communities.</p>

<p>Just about the time Frank James was passing
through from Nelson county to Brandenburg, in
Meade county, on the Ohio river, on his way to Missouri,
a number of horses were stolen in Larue
county. A posse went in pursuit of the thieves.
They traced them to Brandenburg. There they
found Frank James. There were four of them when
they came up with James, and he was alone, sitting
in the office of a hotel. By some means they induced
him to come out, and then they told him he
might consider himself their prisoner on a charge of
horse stealing in Larue county.</p>

<p>"By G&mdash;d! I consider no such proposition," exclaimed
Frank James, as he drew a pistol and commenced
firing. In less time than it requires to state
the fact, two of the posse lay extended in the embrace
of death, and a third was down and writhing
in agony. But the fourth man fired a shot into
Frank's left hip, and then ran away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
The wounded desperado was immediately surrounded
by an excited throng. The ball had taken
effect at the point of his hip, and the wound produced
was not only painful but dangerous. Yet the
superb nerve of the man sustained him in the midst
of an appalling crisis. A perfect storm of excitement
was raging in the town. Threats loud and terrible
were made, and Frank James coolly presented
his pistols as he stood leaning against a post and
ordered the excited crowd to stand back, and they
obeyed him.</p>

<p>Somehow it has always happened that the Jameses
never wanted for friends wherever they have wandered.
It was so on this occasion. Though the
great majority of the people of Brandenburg thirsted
for the blood of the slayer of two men in their
midst, yet that grim young man, though wounded
and suffering, had friends at that town, and in the
midst of the excitement, these came to his assistance,
and he was borne away to a secure place,
where the populace could not tell, and nursed by
tender hands prompted by affectionate hearts. Attended
by a scientific surgeon, the ghastly wound
which had brought him to the very brink of the
abyss of death, began to heal, and in a few weeks
the surgeon who had attended the hidden patient
was able to report that he would surely live and
might ultimately recover entirely from the dreadful
wound.</p>

<p>When Frank had gained some strength, and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
was deemed safe to remove him, in a quiet and secret
manner he was conveyed in a close vehicle to
the house of a staunch friend and relative in Nelson
county, where he remained during many months,
suffering excruciating pain on account of the horrible
wound. He did not entirely recover from the
effects of the wound for several years.</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="small">THE LIBERTY BANK AFFAIR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Certainly no one could say that Jesse James possessed
any of the qualities which would make him</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Like one who on a lonely road</div>
<div class="line i1h">  Doth walk in fear and dread,</div>
<div class="line i0h">And having once turned round, walks on,</div>
<div class="line i1h">  And turns no more his head,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Because he knows a frightful fiend</div>
<div class="line i1h">  Doth close behind him tread."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He was constituted of a different element. If he
ever felt the sense of dread, no one ever knew it, for
certainly none ever saw it exhibited in his conduct.
Yet he knew that he was hunted, knew that shrewd,
bold men sought to bind him in fetters, to deprive
him of liberty, or, failing in that, rob him of life.
And yet this knowledge did not alarm him, and the
very presence of his foes did not make him afraid,
though they numbered "ten strong, brave men."
Perhaps Jesse James never knew what fear meant,
having never experienced the sensation.</p>

<p>It was in 1866, on St. Valentine's day, February
14th, that an event occurred at Liberty, Missouri,
which created intense excitement in that community,
and a profound sensation throughout the West.
The event alluded to was the plundering of the
Commercial Bank of that city of an amount of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
money said to have been nearly $70,000. The robbery
was not effected in the same bold way as characterized
the raids into Russellville, Gallatin, Columbia,
Corydon and other notable incidents in the
career of the James bandits. But inasmuch as the
bank was depleted of its funds, and that the robbery
was unusually bold and audacious, there were many
who secretly believed that Jesse James planned the
robbery, if he did not lead the robbers, and that the
treasures of the bank had been largely diverted to
the individual possession of that noted young man.
It will be remembered that the Liberty bank robbery
occurred at a time when the James Boys were
regarded only in the light of "desperate fighters&mdash;perhaps
sometimes cruel in their vengeance," but
otherwise they were believed to be honest and honorable
men. Hence men were cautious in coupling
the name of any member of the James family with
an act of highway robbery.</p>

<p>But the conviction was strong in the minds of
many people, nevertheless, that the funds of the
Liberty bank had gone to minister to the wants and
satisfy the desires of Jesse James and his friends and
confederates. No immediate action was taken
against him, but as time passed on, and other acts
were committed by Jesse James and his friends,
which were not regarded as either right or proper,
the belief that they had participated in the robbery,
if, indeed, they were not the robbers themselves,
became wide-spread in the community. But in justice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
to Jesse James, it is but right to say that no evidence
directly implicating him in that affair has ever
been secured.</p>

<p>Cole Younger, when asked by a visitor to the
Stillwater penitentiary concerning the Liberty bank
robbery, remarked, "I have always had my opinion
about that affair. If the truth is ever told, many of
the crimes charged to me and my brothers will be
located where they belong." Former friends of
Jesse James are firm in the belief that he was the
instigator of the deed, if not the leader of the brigands
who sacked the bank. This belief, at any
rate, influenced the public mind to no small extent,
and led eventually to an effort to arrest Jesse James
a year afterward, which attempt ended in a bloody
tragedy, as narrated in the next chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="small">JESSE'S SORTIE AGAINST THE MILITIAMEN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When the war closed, Jesse James was sorely
wounded. It was only by the most persistent and
sureful nursing that he could expect to recover.
When he was able to travel he was furnished transportation
from Lexington to go to Nebraska to join
his mother, who was then a fugitive from her home.
It does not appear that he lingered very long in Nebraska,
since we are assured that before the brown
leaves had fallen, Mrs. Samuels had returned to her
old home near Kearney, Clay county, Missouri.
This point appears to be conceded by all who have
written concerning them. Jesse's wounds healed
slowly&mdash;so slowly that after the lapse of a year he
was but just able to ride on horseback a little. During
the summer of 1866 Jesse rode around the country,
but there was still considerable feeling against
him, and he went well armed. Indeed, he always
had his pistols "handy to use." Nothing appears
to have disturbed the quiet of his life until the night
of February 18, 1867.</p>

<p>It was a cold night. The ground was covered
with a thick mantle of snow, and the wind blew bitterly
cold from the north; the full moon shone
brightly on the glittering garments of mother earth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
Jesse James was at his mother's home near Kearney,
Clay county, tossing under the infliction of a
burning fever. His pistols were loaded and rested
beneath his pillow. On that night, five well-armed
and well-mounted militiamen rode to the home of
the James Boys. Dr. Samuels heard the heavy
tread of the armed men on the piazza, and demanded
their business. He was told to open the door. He
went up to confer with the sick ex-Guerrilla. He
asked Jesse what should be done. The sick man
begged his step-father to assist him to the window
so that he might look out upon the crisp snow out in
the moonlight. He looked with a deeper interest at
the five horses hitched in front of the house. They
all had cavalry saddles on their backs. He knew
that they were soldiers, and he well understood the
object of their coming. It was a moment when decisions
must be reached quickly. He had never
surrendered, and he never intended to do so. Hastily
dressing himself, he descended to the floor below
with his pistols in his hands. The militiamen,
impatient at the delay of Dr. Samuels in opening the
door, had commenced hammering at the shutter
with the butts of their muskets, all the while calling
to Jesse to come down and surrender himself. They
swore they knew he was in the house, and vowed to
take him out dead or alive. Jesse crept softly
and close to the door, and listened attentively
until, from the voices, he thought he could get an accurate
aim. He raised a heavy dragoon pistol, placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
the muzzle to within three inches of the upper panel
of the door, and fired. There was a stifled cry, and
a heavy body dropped with a dull thud to the floor
of the piazza. His aim had been deadly. Before
the militiamen could recover from their surprise,
Jesse James had thrown the door wide open, and,
standing on the threshold with a pistol in each hand,
he commenced a rapid and deadly fire. Another
man fell dead, and two more men had received
wounds which were painful and dangerous, and surrendered
to the outlaw they came to capture. The
fifth man, terror-stricken, fled, reached his horse,
mounted him, and rode rapidly away in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Thus was commenced that long strife which has
gone on year after year, and the warfare has made
Frank and Jesse James the most renowned outlaws
who have ever appeared on the American continent.
All the skill and ingenuity of the shrewdest detectives
have been at various times brought into requisition,
but failure has attended all their efforts to
capture the boys.</p>

<p>The scene presented at the Samuels house, after
the flight of the only man of the attacking party
who remained unhurt, was indeed a sad one. Here,
in the cold night wind, extended on the open piazza,
with faces ghastly and white in the moonbeams, lay
the forms of two human beings, who but an hour
before, in the prime of life and the full flush of manhood,
had ridden to the retreat of the wounded and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
sick Guerrilla. They were still in death now. And
the next day friends came weary miles to bear them
away.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i3h">          "Helpless upon their sable biers,</div>
<div class="line">They bore them forth with bitter sighs and tears,</div>
<div class="line">With no gay pageantry they moved along,</div>
<div class="line">Most silent they, amid a silent throng.</div>
<div class="line">And there they left them in that drear abode</div>
<div class="line">Alone with its still tenants and their God."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And there were two more men who had come
with brave hearts and steady hands to capture the
weary, feverish ex-Guerrilla, lying there writhing in
agony after the attempt had been made. They had
come with the hope of delivering Jesse James over
to the law, and thus bind him forever. Now they
lay completely helpless, and in the power of the daring
outlaw, who had the name of being devoid
of the quality of mercy. And yet they were spared
by him.</p>

<p>When a large company of armed men arrived at
the house of Dr. Samuels, the next day, to take
Jesse James dead or alive, that redoubtable adventurer
was many miles away. The place that had
proved so disastrous to the five militiamen the evening
before, was quiet enough now, and the militia
ranged through the old farm-house without molestation.
Jesse was not at home!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="small">IN THE HANDS OF FRIENDS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Jesse James, soon after the night attack before related,
proceeded to Kentucky, where Frank was
stopping with friends. He had not recovered from
the effects of the terrible wounds which he had received
in the breast just after the close of the war.
Frank was still unable to ride abroad on account of
the bullet wound in his hip received on the day of
the Brandenburg tragedy. In the early part of the
summer of 1867, Jesse arrived at the house of a
friend in Nelson county, Kentucky, near the town of
Chaplin. Frank was already there. In this neighborhood
dwelt a large number of people who were
either related to them or devoted admirers of the
noted Guerrillas. They had been the friends and
entertainers of Quantrell, Marion, Sue Mundy, and
others of the Guerrillas in the closing days of the
war.</p>

<p>Soon after his arrival in Chaplin, Jesse, whose condition
seemed to grow worse instead of better, concluded
to place himself under the surgical care of
Dr. Paul F. Eve, of Nashville, Tenn. He proceeded
to Nashville, where he remained for several months,
and received much benefit to his health.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the year 1868 Jesse and Frank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
were once more re-united at the house of a relative
at Chaplin. From all that can be learned, the life
led by the wounded desperadoes while with their
Kentucky friends was as pleasant as could be expected
under the circumstances. There was a large
community of people in that section who were intensely
Southern in feeling, and mourned the defeat
of the cause for which so many noble lives had been
sacrificed, with an intense grief. Every one who had
fought for that cause was dear to them, and when the
Missouri youths came to the homes of the Samuels,
and McClaskeys, and Russels, and Thomases, and
Sayers, they were sure to receive a warm welcome.</p>

<p>In that part of Kentucky there were scattered
about many of the adventurous partisans who had
followed Sue Mundy, Magruder, Marion and other
Guerrilla chiefs in the days of the war. With some
of these Frank James had served in the closing days
of Quantrell's career.</p>

<p>The Jameses were feted and feasted by the hospitable
Kentuckians, and so tenderly nursed that their
wounds had very much improved. Logan county
was also the home of many of their friends, and numerous
relatives of the boys, and between these and
those residing in Nelson county, they passed to and
fro at will, and wherever they might happen to rest,
they were honored guests of families who possessed
the pecuniary means to enable them to be hospitable.
Fair ladies smiled on them, and gentle hands were
ready to serve them in the hour of pain. It seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
that they should have been happy, or at least contented.</p>

<p>But the James boys' career had been stormy; they
had an active, restless disposition; they had lost the
delicate sensibilities of well organized members of
society, and the rough experiences through which
they had passed had evidently destroyed, in a measure,
whatever of human sympathy had belonged to
their nature.</p>

<p>And yet at this time their friends&mdash;and they had
many&mdash;believed them to be honorable and honest, if
desperate in conflict. They knew that they had
killed many men, but this was excused, because the
men killed were enemies, and the killing was done
in combats. So it came about that these most noted
of outlaws for many years had friends who believed
in their integrity, and were ready at all times to engage
in the defense of their character.</p>

<p>The times were favorable. There were many desperate
young men turned adrift by the events of the
war; men ready to engage in any undertaking which
promised excitement and gain. Over such, Jesse
and Frank James could exercise a large influence,
and from among such they drew allies in the commission
of crime.</p>

<p>The individual members of organizations which
had hovered along the borders, and hung on the
verge of the great field of warfare, in character one
half soldier and the other half bandit, were just the
kind of men from whose ranks recruits for lawless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
enterprises could be enlisted. In Kentucky and
Tennessee, Arkansas and Missouri, there were many
such persons&mdash;men who, during the great strife, when
mighty hosts clashed against each other, and tremendous
events were taking place, had occupied an
anomalous position which brought upon them the
hate of the Federals, and incurred for them the displeasure
of the Confederates, were in a position
where a step further could not materially alter their
relations to society. The men who had fought with
regiments, banded in great armies, whether on the
side of the Federals or Confederates, did not look
with any great consideration on those who had lingered
along the borders of war, as independent
companies of scouts and Guerrillas.</p>

<p>There were many men in Kentucky at the time of
which we speak who had been in organizations of
the character above described&mdash;that is, Guerrilla
bands, both Federal and Confederate. The regular
soldiers of both armies, whose families had suffered
in consequence of the partisan warfare, looked with
ill-concealed dislike upon the free riders of the border,
and this fact, no doubt, had a large influence in
driving many of the Guerrillas into downright outlawry
when the war had closed. It was in a community
of ex-Guerrillas that Frank and Jesse found
themselves in Kentucky, and among such "friends,"
no doubt, their first great project of bank robbing
had its inception and complete maturity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="small">THE RUSSELLVILLE BANK ROBBERY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Russellville is a beautiful village&mdash;almost grown
to a city&mdash;in a lovely region of country in Logan
county, Kentucky. The people of Russellville are
educated and refined. It is the seat of much wealth
and boasts its colleges and academies. In general,
Russellville is a quiet place, and from year in to year
out its quietude is not often broken by any startling
incident. But things will occur everywhere, sometime,
to create a profound sensation. It happened
that this quiet, prim old place should have a great
and notable sensation.</p>

<p>It was a bright morning in March. The blue birds
had returned and were singing their matin songs
from the budding branches of the trees. Russellville
was as staid and sober as usual. There was not a
single thing to indicate that the old town was about
to be shaken up as it had never been before. The
bank doors stood wide open, and the cashier stood
at his desk. An old lady hobbled down the street,
and a fresh school-miss paused to gaze at the early
spring flowers which adorned a neighbor's garden;
a kitchen maid was singing a ditty to her absent
swain in the back yard; and a sturdy citizen crossed
the street to inquire if a certain bill which he held in
his hands was good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Nothing strange in all this? Of course not. People
were simply minding their affairs according to
their own inclinations. There was a sudden clatter
of hoofs that morning, the 20th of March, 1868.
Terrible shouts and fearful oaths, and the sharp reports
of pistols accompanied the sound of the horses'
hoofs. The old lady suddenly dropped her staff
and stood as if petrified; the young miss ran hastily
away; the cashier turned pale, and the sturdy citizen
hastily retreated back across the street. A dozen
horsemen, armed with two pairs of revolvers each,
rode furiously about the streets, and with fearful oaths
commanded the people to keep in their houses. Two
of the men rode to the bank, dismounted and rushed
in. One of them presented a pistol at the head of
the cashier, and commanded him, under penalty of
instant death, to be still and make no noise. The
other took out the contents of the safe, amounting to
many thousands of dollars; they then remounted
and rode away. In a few minutes the streets of Russellville
were comparatively deserted. The brigands
had come in, secured their plunder, and had as suddenly
disappeared; the citizens scarcely knew what
had happened. Surprise prevented immediate pursuit.
The bandits had taken the road toward the
Mississippi. They were traced to that stream and
across to the rugged hills of Southeast Missouri, and
then the trail divided up, and all marks of their passage
were lost. They found friends, did these bandits,
in West Missouri.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Who were the bold raiders? Where did they
come from and where did they go when they secured
the rich booty from the plundered bank? The good
friends of the James boys declared that it was impossible
that they could have participated in that
affair. In substantiation of this position they
pointed to the fact that Jesse James was at
the town of Chaplin, in Nelson county, which is fifty
miles or more from Russellville, and that incomparable
raider himself wrote a letter for publication in the
Nashville (Tennessee) <cite>American</cite>, in which he triumphantly
points to the fact that at the very time of the
raid on Russellville, he was at the Marshall House,
Chaplin, and refers to Mr. Marshall, the proprietor
of the hotel, for the truth of the statement, that on a
certain day in March, 1868, he was at his house. But
unfortunately the date of the robbery, and the day
which Jesse asserts he spent at Chaplin, were not the
same days. It was no uncommon thing for Jesse
James to make more than fifty miles on horseback in
six hours, in those days when the roads were good.
He rode no inferior animals&mdash;the best blooded horses
of old Kentucky were bestridden by the daring
raider.</p>

<p>Another thing: Jesse James was only seen in
Chaplin the day after the robbery, and in the evening
at that; even if he had been seen late the <em>same</em>
evening after the robbery, it would not have constituted
even a presumptive evidence of his innocence,
since after the robbery occurred in the morning he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
could have ridden to Chaplin before nightfall. Just
previous to the robbery, Jesse had spent much of his
time in Logan county, almost a dozen miles from
Russellville, with relatives, of whom he had a number
residing in that region. As we have before stated,
Frank had been severely wounded while resisting
arrest at Brandenburg; but he was then so far recovered
that he had no difficulty in riding on horseback.
He had made a number of journeys between his
usual stopping place at Mr. Sayers' house in Nelson
county, and the houses of his kin in Logan
county. The statement made by Jesse that Frank
was at the house of Mr. Thompson, in San Luis
Obispo county, California, at the time of the Russellville
bank robbery, is incorrect. Frank had not then
visited California.</p>

<p>The friends of the boys, however, were unable to
make a clear defense for them, and they have been
generally credited with being not only participators,
but leaders of the raiders.</p>

<p>At the time of the robbery, Geo. W. Shepherd,
Oliver Shepherd, and several others of "the old
Guerrilla guard," as they were called, had their homes
or stopping places in Nelson county. Geo. Shepherd
had married the widow of the noted Missouri
Guerrilla, Dick Maddox, who was a member of the
band which Quantrell led out of that State. This redoubtable
warrior, who had assisted at Lawrence and
Centralia, and had participated in many desperate
and bloody affrays, met his fate in a terrible conflict
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
with a Cherokee Indian. Maddox and Shepherd had
been friends and comrades in the dark days when
they rode with Quantrell, and as Mrs. Maddox was
left alone in a strange land, and was yet young in
years and comely in features, George Shepherd
readily agreed to console the widow in her affliction
and perform the duty of a faithful comrade to the
memory of his friend by espousing his widow. They
were married and settled in Chaplin before the raid
on the bank.</p>

<p>The people of Russellville quickly recovered from
their surprise by the audacity of the robbers. The
officers of the law rallied, and there was mounting in
hot haste and an earnest pursuit of the robbers. Oll.
Shepherd had suddenly disappeared from Chaplin;
several of the old Guerrillas had also gone away,
and Frank and Jesse James, too, had quietly departed
from that region of country.</p>

<p>The Kentucky blood of the pursuers was up, and
they followed the trail of the robbers with tireless
energy. They were traced west over hills and
through valleys. The Cumberland river was crossed,
and through the rugged region between that stream
and the Tennessee, they were tracked as foxes might
have been trailed. But the pursuers were always
just too late to come up with the gang. Still they
followed on, and finally reached the banks of the
Mississippi only to learn that the persons they sought
had crossed before their arrival, and plunged into the
wilderness regions of Southeast Missouri. Some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
effort was made to keep on the track of the fugitives
through the swamps of Missouri, but the traces became
fainter and fainter as the pursuers advanced,
until among the rugged hills of the Southeast they
faded out altogether, and the Kentuckians were
forced to give up the chase and reluctantly returned
home after a bootless pursuit.</p>

<p>George Shepherd had married a wife&mdash;moreover,
he had bought a house at Chaplin&mdash;and therefore he
did not travel with his comrades to the West. The
officers of the law soon found him, and as he was
one of the suspected parties, and the bank robbers
had taken Shepherd's horses on which to escape, he
was arrested and a thorough search was made for
evidence to convict him. He was taken to Russellville
and placed in jail. The grand jury of Logan
county at its next sitting found an indictment against
him, and he was in due time arraigned before the
Logan county circuit court on a charge of aiding and
abetting the robbers. The evidence was deemed
conclusive by the jury before which he was tried, and
a verdict of guilty was returned and the punishment
was fixed at three years in the penitentiary at hard
labor.</p>

<p>The other members of the band escaped to Western
Missouri. Oll Shepherd, a cousin of George
Shepherd, was found in Jackson county by the persistent
Kentuckians. They desired to arrest him. A
requisition was procured from the Governor of Kentucky,
and the executive order of the Chief Magistrate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
of Missouri, for the arrest of the fugitive. But
Oll Shepherd was an old Guerrilla, and he flatly refused
to be taken back to Kentucky as a prisoner.
The civil officers were deterred from executing the
warrant of arrest. In those days there were vigilance
committees in Missouri. To one of these the situation
of affairs was reported. It was at once determined
by the vigilantes that Oll Shepherd must either
submit to arrest or be killed. The company of vigilantes
found him at his home near Lea's Summit.
Would he surrender? they demanded of him.
"Never! death first," he shouted back to them.
Then the bloody work began. But what could one
man do against twenty-five? There could be but
one result. The one man must die at last, however
bold and skillful. So it resulted in this case. Oll
Shepherd had been an old Guerrilla under Quantrell,
and had learned how to shoot and how to despise
fear. He resisted, and not until he had received
seven bullet wounds did he succumb. In fact, he
died fighting.</p>

<p>The other members of the gang implicated in the
Russellville robbery escaped. The Jameses soon after
went to the Pacific Coast, and remained there for
quite a while. They were on a tour in search of
health. The hard life which they had led and the desperate
wounds which they had received had sadly
impaired their superb physical systems, and they
needed rest and time to recuperate wasted energies
and allow their wounds to heal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
Meanwhile, George Shepherd, shut out from the
world, toiled on at his unrequited tasks in the penitentiary
at Frankfort. He who had been the free
rover and wild Guerrilla, the dauntless rider and relentless
foe, in the garb of a convict did service to
the State, and answered not again when ordered to
his daily rounds of labor. And he alone of the survivors
of that band of freebooters who rode so fearlessly
and madly into Russellville that morning, bent
on mischief and crime, was made to feel the heavy
rod of retributive justice. Oll Shepherd had perished.
Nemesis had overtaken some of the old
Guerrillas.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="small">ON THE PACIFIC SLOPE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Immediately after the Russellville robbery, Jesse
James appeared once more in his old haunts in Missouri.
But his physical system had been greatly
taxed by the tremendous strain to which it had been
subjected. Twice already had he received bullet
wounds through the lungs which would have killed
any man less extraordinarily endowed with vitality.
Scars of twenty wounds were on his person, and yet
the man who had gone out from home as a boy;
entered into close affiliation with a band of the most
daring and desperate men ever organized in America;
sustained his part with them, and even surpassed
them all in the daring feats they accomplished
ere yet the "manly beard had shaded his face,"
after having passed through more exciting scenes
than any living man, and participated in more terrible
encounters than most men, yet survived, and
though his terrible wounds had weakened his frame,
yet his wonderful courage and tremendous reserve
of vital forces were such as to insure his final restoration
to complete health.</p>

<p>He had traveled on horseback from the little town
of Chaplin, on the eastern verge of Nelson county,
in Central Kentucky, to the western border of Missouri,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
in the space of a few days subsequent to the
20th of March, 1869. Jesse James was seen in Clay
county, Missouri, in the first days of April of that
year, and was seen at Chaplin on the 18th of March.
That he was at Russellville the evidence seems to be
clear; and that he led a most exciting retreat from
that place, through the hill country of Kentucky,
until he reached the banks of the Mississippi, is one
of the facts of his history. It was his genius which
enabled his confederates to escape from a determined
pursuit of resolute men. Once on the west bank of
the Mississippi, to use a Westernism, "he was on his
own stamping ground." He knew every "trail"
across the swamps of Southeastern Missouri, and
every pathway in the tangled brakes over the rugged
hills of the southern counties of that State, were as
familiar to him as the woodlands about the old farm
in Clay county. He knew more&mdash;that there were
scattered through the country from Chaplin to Kearney,
a route of more than five hundred miles in
length, men with the reputation of respectable members
of society, who always had a warm welcome for
him and his daring men. Who, then, could pursue
and capture him? There is no room for wonder that
Jesse James escaped the irate Kentuckians, who followed
his trail from Russellville to the banks of the
Mississippi, and finally lost it among the rugged hills
and vast forests west of the river.</p>

<p>Jesse's extraordinary journeys under such circumstances
did not tend to the restoration of his physical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
system, which had been greatly shattered by the
terrible wounds which he had received at the close
of the war, in an encounter with a company of Federal
soldiers in Lafayette county.</p>

<p>In those days the friends of the Jameses were numerous
in the State of Missouri; for at that time
scarcely any one believed that they had developed
into brigands. Among those who advised with
Jesse James at that time was his physician and
friend, Dr. Joseph Wood, of Kansas City. It was
the opinion of this physician that the condition of
his patient imperatively demanded a change of
scene, and a more genial climate to insure his restoration.</p>

<p>In accordance with this advice, the patient set about
his preparations for a voyage by sea, and a sojourn
on the Pacific slope.</p>

<p>Toward the close of May, 1869, Jesse James left
the home of his mother near Kearney, Missouri, for
New York. Here he spent only a few days. On
the 8th of June he embarked on the steamship Santiago
de Cuba, bound for Aspinwall, crossed the
Isthmus to Panama, and there again took a steamer
for San Francisco. The spoils of Russellville allowed
him means to gratify every desire in the "City of
the Golden Gate," and he remained there for some
time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Frank James, who was not deemed
able to make the long ride, in the flight before the
officers at Russellville, was secluded for a time in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
house of a respectable citizen of Nelson county,
Kentucky. But it was not deemed best that Frank
should linger long in that part of the country. A
friend provided a close carriage, and a few weeks
after the Russellville robbery Frank James was very
quietly driven northward one evening, passing by
Bloomfield, through Fairfield, by Smithville, and on
through Mount Washington to Louisville. Here he
remained a few days, and then took the cars for St,
Louis. Arrived in that city, Frank put up at the
Southern Hotel, registering as "F. C. Markland,
Kentucky." The name was one he had used before
when he did not desire that his real name and character
should be known. Here he met two or three
of his old comrades, and he spent several days very
pleasantly with them. Meanwhile he communicated
with his mother and apprised her of his intention to
go West across the Rocky Mountains. Mrs. Samuels
met her son at the house of a relative in Kansas
City, where he remained for two days, and then bidding
farewell to those who had always been true to
him, he took passage for California, where he arrived
some weeks before the arrival of Jesse. Frank did
not remain long in San Francisco, but proceeded
very soon to San Luis Obispo county, and paid a
visit to his uncle, Mr. D. W. James, who was at that
time proprietor of the Paso Robel Hot Sulphur
Springs, a much frequented resort of invalids in that
county. The friends of the Boys, and Jesse James
himself, in a published letter, claim that Frank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
went by sea to California, and that he sailed from
New York on one of the vessels belonging to the
Pacific Mail Steamship Line. But this story was
doubtless set afloat to mislead the public concerning
the movements of the Boys. The above account we
have from a gentleman who was at that time a friend
of the Jameses, and who traveled with Frank from
Kansas City to San Francisco. He knew the desperado
well, and had daily conversations with him
on the journey.</p>

<p>After spending some time at the Springs, Frank
James proceeded to the ranche of Mr. J. D. Thompson,
with whom he had a previous acquaintance,
gained while that gentleman was visiting in the
States. The noted ex-Guerrilla remained at the Laponsu
ranche for many months, and until after the
arrival of Jesse.</p>

<p>The two brothers met at Paso Robel. Here they
remained for several months. In the autumn they
went out to the mining districts of Nevada.</p>

<p>It appears, from information in the possession of
the writer, that the Boys behaved themselves with
much circumspection while they were the guests of
their uncle. Their evil propensities were suppressed,
and no one who came in contact with the quiet,
sedate Frank, and the genial, companionable Jesse,
during those days, would have suspected that these
brothers were the most daring and dangerous men
who had ever yet defied the powers of the State,
and disregarded the demands of society. Some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
quiet weeks had been passed. The weak lungs of
Jesse had healed, and the lame hip of Frank was
well again. The climate had wrought a wonderful
change in their physical systems. Jesse had grown
robust, and possessed all the powers of physical endurance
which have been since tested and proved incomparable.</p>

<p>The quiet life at Paso Robel began to be irksome
to the men whose lives had been passed amid the
rudest shocks and the wildest storms of excitement
and passion. They would go out among the miners
and have a little fun while prospecting there. In
Nevada, society was in its rudest stages of development.
The country was filled with adventurers from
every country under the sun. In the camps of the
miners and prospectors were desperadoes from all
regions, and a visitor to these places who wanted to
fight only had to say so, and there was no delay in
getting accommodated. It was then flush times in
the Bonanza State.</p>

<p>Frank and Jesse went up to the mountains to take
a look at the country. They formed some acquaintances
among the adventurers, and they found several
old acquaintances from Missouri and Kentucky.
The rude life of the mining camps was more congenial
to the disposition of the men who had rode with
Quantrell than the refined society found about a
fashionable resort for invalids; and the restless raiders
liked well to linger in the tents of the miners
among the lofty summits of the Sierras. For a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
while they passed their time very pleasantly in such
associations. They prospected some, and played
sportsmen in the intervals of time so spent.</p>

<p>But their pleasant days in the Sierras were doomed
to draw to an abrupt close. There was a new camp
formed at a place called Battle Mountain. It will be
remembered that we are writing of a period when
the rich mineral discoveries of Nevada had drawn a
miscellaneous population from the four quarters of
the globe. Camps and towns sprang up like Jonah's
gourd&mdash;in a night, and disappeared with the noonday
sun of the morrow. Battle Mountain was "a
rattling place;" the people who had pitched their
tents there had come in search of gold. Many of
them were old pioneers, accustomed to hard knocks
and sudden surprises. Others were "hard visaged
men," who knew how to flee before the avengers of
blood&mdash;a knowledge gained during years of practical
experience. They were quick with the knife, and
"lightning shots." They were inured to scenes of
danger, and were not liable to suffer from sudden
surprises. Frank and Jesse James, accompanied by
two old Missouri acquaintances, concluded to pay a
visit to Battle Mountain, "to shake up the encampment,"
as they said. They found spirits there who
were congenial and some who were uncongenial.
At last they brought up at a shanty where women,
whisky and cards united their attractions to allure
the old pioneers and chance visitors. The Jameses
do not drink, but they claim to be "handy with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
pasteboard." Here they engaged in a game of
cards with two notorious roughs and blacklegs; and
their companions also found a pair of gamesters,
ready and anxious to join them in a "bout of
poker."</p>

<p>For a time the game proceeded without anything
occurring to disturb the amicable relations of the
players. At last one of the old Missouri friends of
the Jameses detected his opponent cheating in the
game. He charged him with it, and the other denied
the charge and demanded a retraction. Of
course nothing of that sort could happen. The
gambler retorted by drawing a knife, and the other
snatched a pistol from his belt. Jesse James, who
was sitting at a table a little distance away, saw the
danger of his friend, and in an instant, just as the
gambler was in the act of striking the Missourian,
he threw his pistol out and shot the blackleg through
the heart. As he turned, the man who had been
sitting opposite to him, engaged in play, had a pistol
leveled at his breast. Jesse brought his pistol around
with a swing, and another gambler fell without a
groan to the earth&mdash;dead!&mdash;shot through the brain.
By this time the utmost confusion prevailed. Lights
were overturned, and the place was shrouded in utter
darkness in an instant of time. There was a crowd
of twenty or thirty men in the shanty when the firing
commenced. Every man was armed, and all had
their weapons in hand. Jesse cried out:</p>

<p>"Stand aside! Be ready!" The other three men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
of the party understood what he meant. It was for
them to get out, and they rushed for the door. A
pistol would flash and a heavy body would fall with
a thud to the ground. When the door had been
gained by his companions, Jesse, who had covered
their exit, sprang forward to escape from that pandemonium
of darkness, suffering and death. Pistols
were popping and knives were clashing in a horrid
din. The maimed, writhing in agony, mingled their
groans and curses in the awful uproar. By the
flashing of pistols, Jesse saw that Frank and his two
friends had made their exit, and were firing into the
crowd as opportunity offered, taking care to not
shoot toward him. He determined to leave the
shanty, but two burly roughs, with huge knives,
stood in the way. A pistol ball quieted one of
them, and almost before the flash of his pistol had
faded away, and before the other could think of
using his knife, Jesse sprang upon him and dealt
him a fearful blow on the head with the butt of his
pistol. The gambler sank with a groan to the earth,
and with a spring Jesse joined his friends on the outside.
By this time a light had been placed on a
barrel behind the slab which served for a counter.
Three men were seen weltering in their own blood&mdash;dead.
Four others were lying writhing in pain, and
all were gory from the blood which flowed from
ghastly wounds.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_100.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>Fight in a Gambler's Den.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The crowd saw all this at a glance. The dead and
the wounded in the shanty did not include any of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
the strangers. The crowd yelled for vengeance on
the authors of the bloody tragedy. There was a
shout that awakened the mountain echoes for miles
around, as the infuriated pioneers and gamblers
surged out of the shanty.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Jameses and their friends had retired
a short distance from the place to ascertain the
extent of the injuries they had received in the
melee. It was a cloudless night and the stars shone
brightly. The leaders of the mob soon discovered
the four Missourians, and ran, yelling, toward them.</p>

<p>"Back, you d&mdash;d miscreants! Stand back, I say!"
cried Jesse James.</p>

<p>But they rushed forward at the top of their speed.</p>

<p>"Boys, we are in for it," said Jesse, quietly. "All
right, be ready." Then he shouted:</p>

<p>"Come on, d&mdash;n you! Just come ahead and be
killed!" He had no more than ceased speaking
when they had approached near enough to open fire.</p>

<p>"Wait, boys! Steady! Every shot must tell!
Now!" And as the sound of the last word died
away, there was the report of four pistols, almost
simultaneously discharged, and four men fell badly
wounded; once more the four deadly pistols were
discharged, and two more of the howling mob sank
down in their tracks. The others paused. But they
gave the Missourians a parting salute as the latter
moved rapidly away. That salute seriously wounded
one of the friends of the Jameses, and carried away
a portion of Jesse's hat brim. But they escaped,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
aided by the night, and hastily returned to Winnemucca.
Here they learned that intelligence of the
terrible dark seance at Battle Mountain had preceded
them, and that it was not a safe place. Aided by
friends, they remained in seclusion a few days, waiting
an opportunity to get away. During these days
of retirement they made up their minds to return to
the States east of the mountains, and when they met
a favorable opportunity they embraced it, and in
another week after their departure they were secure
among friends near their old haunts in Missouri,
ready to plan still more startling campaigns than
any which they had yet undertaken.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="small">WERE THEY DRIVEN TO OUTLAWRY?</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i8">                "Those misnamed men</div>
<div class="line">Whom damned custom had brazed so</div>
<div class="line">That they were proof and bulwark against sense."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Were the James boys driven to outlawry?</p>

<p>A strange question, no doubt, many readers will
think, in the light of the history of their lives. And
yet it is a pertinent question, when we consider the
tendency of the human mind and conscience to deteriorate
under the pressure of circumstances. Environments
have much to do in molding character.
Perhaps there is not as wide a space between the
natural characteristics of mind and heart in boys of
eight as is generally supposed. But philosophizing
aside. Are there not mitigating circumstances in the
case of the James boys? We do not undertake to
defend them&mdash;their course is indefensible; we cannot
apologize for them; for outlawry cannot be palliated.
But let justice be done even to these renowned outlaws.
Though sinners, have they not been sinned
against? Though slayers of men, have they had no
provocation? Let facts speak.</p>

<p>When the banner, beloved by the Southern people,
whether wisely or unwisely, it matters not, was folded
away forever at Appomattox, that event brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
peace and repose to hundreds, nay, thousands of
grim, worn soldiers who had bravely striven to uphold
the ensign they loved so well. The war ended
for them, never to be commenced again.</p>

<p>But all along the bloody borderland there existed
a distinctly different condition of affairs. The warfare
was that of community against community, of
neighbor against neighbor, and of relative against
relative. Cole Younger, the Guerrilla, engaged in
mortal combat with Charles Younger, the Union
militia officer; it was kindred blood that strove. In
such a warfare the common ties of humanity are severed,
and fury and hate come in where love and
friendship have expired. Such was the situation in
Missouri. The dissolution of the Confederate Government
did not restore peace in such communities.
The quarrel was no longer political, and for principle,
but personal, and for vengeance. For others there
might be peace, but for contestants in such a strife
there was no peace.</p>

<p>If Jesse James took vengeance on Bond, it must
be remembered that in the dreadful days of the bitter
border war, Bond had gone with his band of militia
to the Samuels' place, taken Dr. Samuels, Jesse's
step-father, out, and hanged him by the neck until
they supposed he was dead, and left him there while
they went to find Jesse, who was plowing in the
field. He was but a lad then. But they took him,
tied him like a felon, and castigated him like a slave
with a plow line, until faint from loss of blood and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
crazed from the agony of the infliction, he fell in a
swoon&mdash;a mere quivering mass of flesh and blood.
Jesse James was like other youthful human beings.
Could he then forget such treatment? Was it not
natural that he should seek vengeance? And the
hour came; the tormentor fell into his hands; the
strong passion overcame the young man, and he slew
his enemy. And so, too, with Banes and others who
fell victims to his relentless purpose. They met a
fate at the hands of the boys which, perhaps, better
men than the Jameses would have connived at under
similar circumstances. Thus, during the long, dark
struggle, old scores were paid, but at the same time
new causes of offense were given.</p>

<p>The regularly organized armies of the late contending
sections had been disbanded, and peace ostensibly
reigned in the land. But old wounds had
not healed along the border. There were malignant
stars in the zenith of the Guerrillas. Hope animated
them for a space. They sought their childhood's
homes. Doubtless they loved the scenes familiar to
them in the old days, before they had learned to be
slayers of men, as well as others of the race do that
anchor-spot of memory. But the bright gleam of
hope faded; the clouds of anguish overspread their
sky. The lurid lightning of the old bitterness
flashed athwart their heavens, and the ex-Guerrillas
were pursued and hunted, like felons, beyond the pale
of hope or pardon.</p>

<p>The resources of the James family had been impaired,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
absorbed, wasted, in the crucial time of strife.
But they were not permitted to make a peaceful effort
to build up and restore wasted fortunes. Harassed
on every hand, these boys, who were naturally
of a strong temperament, and perhaps of revengeful
natures, were yet mere boys who had learned to be
self-reliant; impatient of restraint, bold in action,
and acquainted with the art of slaughter, turned upon
their hunters and revealed the desperate character
of the game they pursued. They were not left in
peace after the light of peace blessed the land and
made glad other hearts; and they would have been
more than human not to have undertaken their own
protection under such circumstances. If others attempted
to murder them, they did not hesitate to
slay. So their lives have become lurid with slaughter.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that we are not attempting
to justify such a line of conduct; but there are
many things in connection with human affairs that
cannot be defended. We look at things as they
are, and not as they ought to be. Doubtless, it will
be admitted on all hands that the James boys ought
not to have led such a wild career of outlawry; that
they ought not to have entered upon such a course
of action; and finally it will be urged that it would
have been far better for them, and everything and
everybody connected with them, to have quietly
yielded to the inevitable, and voluntarily exiled
themselves forever from the scenes of childhood and
all the dear associations of their tenderer and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
hopeful youth. Certainly, it would have been best
for them. But such a course would have been contrary
to the world's experience of human nature.</p>

<p>So when vigilance committees were hanging their
comrades who had been with them by the camp fires
in the deep forests, and in many a bloody foray; and
when armed men, fours and sixes, hunted for them;
when repose was banished from their home, and the
phantom shadow of death peered out at them from
every forest thicket, and from the sombre shades of
the silent night, these boys rose up in rebellion against
that society which refused to own them, and that order
which organized the cohorts of vengeance.
Jesse W. and Frank James, the terrible Guerrillas of
the war-time, were henceforth to "become enemies
of every man," or at least outlaws from society, and
free companions of the highways. It might have
been different with them. But the long, lingering
fires of hate burned after the lurid days of slaughter,
and they were not the persons to refuse the gauntlet
when thrown at their feet. Never too good by nature,
circumstances have made them desperate, and
hence, after concluding their bloody Guerrilla record,
we proceed with their history as outlaws and highwaymen
of the most remarkable character of any
known in the annals of history.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="small">THE GALLATIN BANK TRAGEDY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The sudden appearance among the people of a
peaceful community of a band of armed men, who
whoop like savages, fire off pistols, swear fearful
oaths, and issue sharp commands, is calculated to
produce a feeling of terror, and, for a time at least,
to paralyze the energies of men. By pursuing this
kind of tactics, the band of robbers which commenced
at Russellville, Kentucky, in 1868, and concluded
their last exploit at Glendale, in the fall of
1879, have uniformly, with one single exception,
been able to accomplish their work and make good
their escape.</p>

<p>The 16th day of December, 1869, will not be soon
forgotten by the citizens of the flourishing little city
of Gallatin, Daviess county, Missouri, because of an
incident which created a thrill of excitement that
extended all over the land. Daylight bank robberies
were not events of frequent occurrence until
these later times. The affair at Russellville had
taken place many months before, and it was thought
altogether unlikely that such another audacious robbery
would be soon attempted.</p>

<p>After the Russellville affair, it was known Jesse
and Frank James had made a journey to California,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
and it was not until late in the fall that they returned.
It was supposed that only the Youngers and Jameses
were capable of doing such deeds, and it was not
known that the Boys were at home by any considerable
number of people.</p>

<p>Such conclusions as these proved to be fallacious.
On the day named&mdash;a gray, cold December day&mdash;the
people of Gallatin were suddenly startled by the
presence, in the streets of the place, of a band of
armed men, who rode furiously, shouted loudly, and
swore fiercely at the people, commanding them, in
sharp, decisive tones, to get inside their houses and
stay within their own domicils. While a part of the
band remained out in the streets, two of the robbers
rushed into the bank. The cashier, Captain John
W. Sheets, was behind the counter. He was instantly
covered by a pistol, and imperiously commanded
to be still. The other robber proceeded to
secure the contents of the safe, placed the bank's
assets in a sack, and walking to the cashier, he placed
the muzzle of a pistol almost against his temple, and
fired, the bullet crashing through the brain, and the
unfortunate gentleman fell dead at the foot of his
slayer. The robbers regained their horses, mounted,
and the whole gang rode rapidly away.</p>

<p>The citizens of Gallatin had seen them come and
go. They did not remain long. The whole affair
was the work of a few moments. They soon realized
what had been done, and then there was mounting
in hot haste, and almost as quickly as the robbers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
had come and gone, a well-armed posse was
riding after them in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>Captain John W. Sheets, the murdered cashier of
the Gallatin bank, served as a captain in the Missouri
militia, and had often met parties of Guerrillas
in combat during the war. He was much esteemed,
and his wanton assassination created a profound sensation,
and a strong desire to capture his slayers
was manifested throughout the community. The
whole country was aroused. Daviess county had sent
many men to the ranks of the militia, and somehow
the impression rapidly went abroad that the robbery
had been committed by the James Boys and their
old associates among the Guerrillas. It stimulated
them to greater exertions in the pursuit. The robbers
obtained the start, and the men who had ridden
with Quantrell never made a reconnoissance on indifferent
steeds. Besides, no dashing cavaliers knew
better how to ride than they. It was an exciting
chase. The people of Gallatin had been taken by
surprise. The startling suddenness of the appearance
of the robbers; their matter-of-fact attention
to the business in hand, and the terrible tragedy
which concluded the drama, were well calculated to
create surprise, not to say astonishment.</p>

<p>The robbers were trailed directly toward Clay
county. The Gallatin posse, after a hot chase, came
up with the fleeing bandits. The latter turned upon
their pursuers in so determined a way that they were
compelled to call a halt, and retreat to meet reinforcements.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
This gave the robbers time. They
continued to retire toward the Clay county line.
It was not difficult to trace them into that
county. But after they had once penetrated well
into the territory of Clay, all traces faded out. No
one had seen such a band of men or any other gang
like them, and all efforts to discover their retreat
proved abortive. They disappeared&mdash;like the picture
thrown out by the magic lantern when the slide is
withdrawn suddenly and broken&mdash;at once and forever.</p>

<p>Hearing that they were accused of the robbery,
the James Boys, who were then at home, mounted
their horses and rode to Kearney to file their protest
against the accusation. Their manner convinced the
citizens&mdash;that it might be dangerous to insist upon
the allegation that they were the Gallatin robbers.</p>

<p>It was given out, in extenuation of the shooting of
Captain Sheets, that the person who did it believed
him to be Lieut. Cox, who, it is said, claimed to have
killed Bill Anderson, when that noted Guerrilla was
attempting to force the passage of the Missouri river
in the face of a superior force of Federal troops.
The murder of the cashier has yet to be avenged.
Not a dollar of the money has been recovered up
to this time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="small">ATTEMPT TO ARREST THE BOYS.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"The past, we may never forget,</div>
<div class="line i1">  The present, swift its moments fly,</div>
<div class="line">The future, we must trust it yet,</div>
<div class="line i1">  And trusting will not sigh."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>After Gallatin, the situation of the boys became
perilous, for although their denials and the affidavits
which they were able to procure, served to convince
their friends that they were not at Gallatin; still the
conviction had grown and deepened that they were
concerned in the robbery, and that they had aided
and abetted those who committed the crime, even if
they were not present in person. Immediately after
the perpetration of the outrage, Jesse W. James wrote
a letter on behalf of himself and his brother Frank,
offering to surrender to the officers of the law and
submit to a trial, on condition that the Governor
should guarantee them against the chances of mob
violence and lynch law in Daviess county.</p>

<p>After examining all the papers in the case, and the
facts submitted to him, Governor McClurg declared
that he did not believe the boys had anything to do
with the robbery, and was fully convinced that they
could not have been personally concerned in it.
This had the effect of quieting the suspicions of many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
persons, but there were others who still cherished the
opinion that they were the instigators of the robbery,
and had aided the perpetrators in concealing themselves,
and had doubtless shared with them the booty
which they had secured. In subsequent years this
opinion grew into a conviction, and now many believe
that it was Frank James' pistol which proved fatal to
Captain Sheets.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, the people of Daviess county
were aroused, and many of the citizens of Clay county
also, indeed all Northwest Missouri was excited.
This led to a systematic and persistent attempt to
arrest Frank and Jesse James, the generally recognized
leaders of the lawless elements of the State.</p>

<p>Among those who firmly believed in the guilt of
the James boys, was Captain John Thomason, of Clay
county, Missouri, a citizen well known and highly
esteemed by the people of the county. Captain
Thomason had served during the war on the Confederate
side, and was known as a man of unimpeachable
courage. The war over, he returned to
his home, and settled down to peaceful pursuits, with
an earnest zeal to repair the losses sustained during
the war. He had been sheriff of Clay county at one
time, and was an outspoken friend of submission to
law. He disapproved of the conduct of the James
boys, and believed that they ought to be arrested
and tried for their misdeeds.</p>

<p>So believing, he had the courage to act. Soon
after the Gallatin robbery, Captain Thomason placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
himself at the head of a posse of resolute men, and
started out to execute his purpose&mdash;the arrest of the
Jameses. These men have never yet been caught
unprepared&mdash;they cannot be surprised. They were
aware of Thomason's purposes, they knew the feelings
which he entertained for them, and they were
ready to meet him. That meeting took place near
the Samuels residence in Clay county. Thomason
demanded their surrender. They laughed at the
idea. Then firing commenced. The affray lasted
but a few minutes. Several shots were fired, and by
one of them Captain Thomason's horse was killed.
The other members of the party did not care to press
upon men so daring, and Frank and Jesse rode away
scathless, and Captain Thomason had to regret the
loss of a valuable horse.</p>

<p>But this little episode did not deter the Captain
from freely expressing his opinion about the boys
and those concerned with them. He had no admiration
for the womanly qualities of their mother, and
expressed himself in language much more forcible
than elegant in regard to her.</p>

<p>Some of his harsh sayings about her came
to the hearing of Mrs. Samuels. She was much incensed
against him on this account, and concluded to
see him about it. It was ten miles from her residence
to Captain Thomason's house; but she mounted a
horse and rode the distance. She entered the house.
The family was dining, and not the slightest attention
was paid to her. She went up to where Captain
Thomason was seated, and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
"Captain Thomason, I understand that you have
called me a&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," replied the sturdy farmer, "and I
want you to understand that if ever I, or any of
mine, are injured by you or yours, in the least thing,
I swear before heaven and earth that there shall not
be a stone left of your house."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" was all the reply she made.</p>

<p>"If any killing is to be done," pursued the Captain,
"it will be well for you to kill all my family, and
leave none to avenge the injury."</p>

<p>Mrs. Samuels saw that Captain Thomason was in
earnest, and that no compromise or apology could
be extorted, and she took her departure.</p>

<p>The efforts of Captain Thomason were not all that
were made for arresting the James boys about the
time of the Gallatin tragedy. The Daviess county
officials hunted them. Detectives from Chicago and
St. Louis tracked them and sought an opportunity
to entrap them. But these shrewd men were not so
to be caught. All attempts to capture them proved
abortive.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="small">OUTRAGE AT COLUMBIA, KENTUCKY.</span></h2>

<p>The James Boys were good travelers, and did not
confine themselves to narrow limits. One week they
might be in Clay county, Missouri, and the next in
Nelson, or Logan, or Jessamine county, Kentucky,
and then in five days more or less they would be in
New York City, and in another week they might be
found in Texas far toward the Mexican border. The
Boys understood the advantages of rapid movements.
When they had "business" on hand, they never appeared
in the vicinity of the scene of their intended
operation. Only one or two of their most trusted
friends, under any circumstances, were allowed to
know anything of their presence in the vicinity.
When going to commit a robbery in a strange place,
the utmost caution was used to keep down even the
suspicion that anything was wrong. Thus it was
with the band at Russellville, and at Gallatin, Mo.
No one had seen them or even heard of any suspicious
characters around. In both cases the first intimation
the citizens had of the presence of banditti in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
their streets was the reports of fire-arms and the
shouts of the dashing robbers as they thundered
along the highways. They appeared as suddenly as
a meteor, and departed as quickly as an apparition.
Such were their tactics at Northfield, where the
Jameses are known to have taken part in the
attempt to rob the bank. Precisely the same order
was observed on the occasion of the outrage at
Columbia, Kentucky, which we shall now proceed to
describe.</p>

<p>Columbia is a pleasant village in Adair county, in
the middle part of the State of Kentucky. In the
region of country in which Adair county is included,
there are many of the relatives of the Boys resident,
and these were then also friends. Columbia is a
quiet village, except during the terms of the courts
which meet there, it being the seat of justice of the
county. At the time which we are now considering,
the courts were not in session, and no more sedate a
town in all Kentucky could be found than Columbia.</p>

<p>It was a lovely afternoon, April 29, 1872. The
genial warmth of the sun had decked the earth in a
carpet of green, clothed the trees in the forest, and
called into being the myriad flowers, whose perfumes
scented the breezy air. It was mild, and one of those
lazy, dreamy afternoons, when, from very excess of
enjoyment of the beauties of reviving nature, men
are disposed to fall into sweet reveries.</p>

<p>But the quietude of Columbia was about to be
rudely broken in upon, the repose of the beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
spring day disturbed, and the place swept by a
storm of excitement such as Columbia never experienced
before. But we will not anticipate.</p>

<p>At the hour of two o'clock, on the afternoon of
April 29th, 1872, Mr. R. A. C. Martin, cashier of the
Deposit Bank at Columbia, and Mr. Garnett, a citizen,
and two friends, were sitting quietly conversing
in the bank office. Neither of the gentlemen was
armed, and no one could have anticipated danger.
Everything in the village was quiet, and the country
around was enjoying the blessings of peace.</p>

<p>A half hour later the equanimity of the gentlemen
was disturbed by the entrance of three men, well
armed, who, with cocked pistols, ordered the cashier
to surrender up the keys of the safe. Another one
attempted to shoot Mr. Garnett, but that gentleman
saved his life by knocking up the pistol, but was burned
slightly by the flame produced by the discharge.
All this was the transaction of a moment of time.</p>

<p>"Will you give up the safe-key, d&mdash;n you?"
shouted one of the robbers, with a cocked pistol
presented at Martin's head.</p>

<p>"I will not," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Then, d&mdash;n you, will you open the safe?
Come, I've no time to wait. If you don't, I will
blow your brains out. Come, will you?"</p>

<p>"I will not. I will d&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words were cut short. The sentence was
never completed. There was a loud report, an involuntary
moan from lips that would never speak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
again, and the lifeless form of R. A. C. Martin, the
brave cashier, fell heavily to the floor. The other
three gentlemen were guarded by one of the robbers,
who kept his pistol cocked and pointed at them, and
in view of their dead friend, jested with them
about the facility with which he could dispatch all
three of them. They had witnessed a demonstration
of his skill, and they trembled for their lives.</p>

<p>Having disposed of the cashier, the two robbers
who were in the bank commenced gathering up all
the money and other valuables which were outside
the safe. They tried to open the safe, but the combination
was with the dead cashier, and the robbers
were baffled.</p>

<p>It was soon known that five men, splendidly
mounted, had entered Columbia, at an hour when
very few people were abroad. They were armed
with heavy dragoon pistols, but as they were divided,
two coming in on one road and three on another,
the citizens did not take the alarm until they heard,
the firing at the bank. Two men held the horses of
the three who went into the bank, and with pistols
fired at every one who appeared on the street; and
by their savage yells and fearful oaths they alarmed
the people to such an extent that the place soon appeared
as if it had been deserted.</p>

<p>Gathering everything they could carry away that
had the semblance of money, placing it in a sack, and,
one of them throwing it across his horse, the three robbers
who had gone inside the building came out, remounted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
their horses, and with a shout which sent a
thrill of terror to the hearts of the citizens of Columbia,
they galloped away unmolested.</p>

<p>The suddenness of the raid; the terrible character
of the men revealed by the murder of so highly esteemed
a citizen as Mr. Martin; the facility with
which they shot a vane off a chimney, and their declarations
that they would murder every man in the
place, which declarations were accompanied by the
most terrible oaths, all had a tendency to demoralize
the men of Columbia. Surprise and consternation
prevented immediate action. But when the cause of
their fears no longer remained, they rallied, and then
commenced a pursuit which continued until in the
mountains of Tennessee, in Fentress county, one of
the robbers, who went by the name of Saunders, was
wounded and finally captured. This man was often
seen, by their friends, with Frank and Jesse James.
This is conclusive of the fact that the Columbia robbery
was committed by the same gang, who for some
years are known to have aided the James Boys and
Younger Brothers in many of their depredations. It
has been asserted by some persons, in a position
to obtain reliable information, that Frank James was
the leader in this raid, and that Bill Longley, the
noted Texas desperado, formed one of the party.
At any rate, none of the robbers were ever caught,
except the Texan, who went by the name of Saunders,
and he was so fatally wounded that death
closed his existence soon after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Martin, the murdered cashier, was a gentleman
held in high regard by the people of Adair county,
and was a member of the Kentucky Legislature at
the time of his tragic death. The failure to catch
the robbers on this occasion had the effect of creating
in the public mind the belief that an organized
band of bank breakers existed, and sometimes the
names of the Jameses and Youngers were mentioned
as leaders of the band.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="small">OUT OF EXILE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>As Frank and Jesse James, the celebrated outlaws,
live separate and apart from the rest of mankind,
they have no confidence in men, and will not
receive the confidence of others. Frank is a self-possessed,
silent man, who cares little for the society
of his fellows. Jesse, on the contrary, under some
circumstances, might have become a rollicking,
good-humored citizen, given to "merry jests and
healthy laughter." Both have schooled themselves
to wariness and a caution which keeps guard over
their words at all times. They are temperate to the
extent of total abstinence from every thing which
could intoxicate. In brief, the James Boys are brave
as men ever become; they are daring, but not reckless;
they are intrepid to a degree perhaps unexcelled
in any who have ever lived on this globe; no
combination of circumstances or conditions can place
them in a position to be surprised. In the midst of
imminent personal danger they are cool and collected
as if they were sitting at a table with a party
of friends. They have made human nature a study,
and have noted its every manifestation. They expect
no mercy from a society which has long ago proscribed
them, and they have little emotional regard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
to waste on that social organization which spurns
them. Brothers in outlawry, separated from the
balance of mankind by an impassable gulf which
they have created themselves, they have learned to
hate the representatives of law and order, and their
defiance is not to be despised.</p>

<p>Superadded to physical courage unequalled, they
possess cunning and craft never surpassed. With
mental gifts which, properly directed, might have
made them renowned as leaders of men in the better
walks of life, they are no trifling foes to the vindicators
of lawful authority.</p>

<p>These brothers, when under their true names,
never even associate together. They do not travel
the same road in company, and never travel the
same way on the same day. Though never together,
they are never far apart. If one needs assistance
the other is sure to be near at hand to render it. If
one should fall, it is safe to assume that his fall would
be terribly avenged by the other. They ride at will
over the vast plains of Texas, nearly always alone,
unless danger threatens, and neither savage aborigines
or wild borderers can make them afraid. They
are veritable roving kings of the plains. In the
haunts of civilization they are no less men to be
dreaded and avoided. The quick pistol and the unerring
aim cannot be despised. Dead men tell no
tales, and the man who would betray will not return
to reveal their counsels. Whicher sought them and
Whicher died; Askew would surrender them, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
he, too, perished on his own threshold. They seem
to possess the occult power of reading other men's
very thoughts. Such are the characteristics of the
James Boys. Bold, shrewd, cool, deliberate men,
whom no danger can appall; no sudden surprise can
disconcert. They are always ready, and can act instantaneously
whatever may be the emergency.</p>

<p>But it must not be supposed that these men, though
outlaws, are exiles from the haunts of men. As
Jameses they are seldom seen, by even the most intimate
of the associates of other days. But they
are not always the terrible outlaws to the seeming of
men. Nor are they condemned to a lonely life away
beyond the borders of civilization among wild herds
and roaming savages. They have travelled much,
and have carefully studied; they know the ways of
the world, and avail themselves of that knowledge to
enjoy some of the privileges and pleasures of civilization.
Many times when they were hunted in the
out-of-the-way regions of the country, they have
been enjoying life as respectable gentlemen among
the citizens of our Metropolitan centers. While
Pinkerton's men have sought them among the forests
of Clay county, Missouri, they have calmly reposed
in the Grand Pacific hotel of Chicago; while McDonough's
"staff" hunted the outlaws in Western
Missouri, they were listening to the soul-stirring
strains of Kellogg and Carey in St. Louis.</p>

<p>It must be known that for years they have led a
double existence. They have many names, and are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
capable of assuming any character. The same circumspection
in speech and action which enables
them to successfully plunder a bank or overhaul an
express train is carried with them into social life, and
enables them to make friends and secure immunity
from annoyance, and disarms all suspicion.</p>

<p>The plundered money of an express train permits
them to appear as gentlemen at the Fifth Avenue
hotel, New York, and Jesse James as Charles Lawson,
of Nottingham, is not regarded as an outlaw in
New York society. It must be remembered that the
James Boys are not altogether illiterate, nor did they
spring from a parentage of uncouth, unlettered rustics.
They have made voyages by sea, and have
been thrown with persons of culture and refinement.
Their father was a man of decided culture, and they
have many relatives of education and refinement.
An uncle of theirs is a somewhat prominent citizen
of California, recognized as a gentleman of intelligence
and good breeding. It is, therefore, not so
difficult for them to play the role of gentlemen even
in refined society.</p>

<p>The Jameses have various names which they assume
as occasion requires. Another peculiarity of
their method is the respectable character of their
friends in their own immediate neighborhoods. These
are respectable farmers and stock-traders, and merchants
and what not. Among their neighbors they
are kind and hospitable, and in every transaction
scrupulously honest. On Sunday they are punctually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
at church service, and are usually liberal contributors
to all neighborhood charities. No one would
for a moment suspect that such persons could possibly
be in league with the most desperate outlaws
who ever lived. Such good neighbors and upright
persons surely can do nothing wrong&mdash;so the people
think. Among these, Frank and Jesse are not known
under their own proper names, and if they were it
would make no difference. They are circumspect
when with such people, and sometimes can assume
the piety of Puritans.</p>

<p>It is related of the boys that on several occasions
after a great robbery, as known and respectable citizens,
they have joined in the pursuit of the marauders
without exciting the least suspicion that they
were concerned in the affair. The following story of
Jesse has been repeated among their acquaintances:</p>

<p>One day&mdash;it was the second after the Corydon
bank robbery&mdash;he was riding along a not much frequented
highway, when he saw two men in pursuit.
Confident that they had not seen him, he turned his
horse's head toward them and rode up the road to
meet them. They were citizens, well mounted and
well armed. Jesse wore Grangers' clothes, and at
once assumed a rustic simplicity which comported
well with his garb. When he had approached near
enough he quietly saluted the robber hunters, and in
a simple manner began to converse with them in the
following style:</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, hev you met anybody up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
road ridin' of a hoss an' leadin ov another one,
'cause you see as how I lives down on the Noderway,
an' some infernal thief has gone off with my
best two hosses. I hearn about two miles furder
back at the blacksmith's shop that er man passed
there about a hour an' a half ago with two hosses, an'
they fits the descripshun of mine to a T. Hev you
seen sich?"</p>

<p>"No. Where are you travelling from?"</p>

<p>"Why, Lord, I've come all the way from the Noderway.
The infernal thieves are just usin' us up
that way. I wish I'd come on the infernal son of a
seacook whose taken my hosses. I do, you bet, I'd
go fur him with these 'ere irons. I would that!"
And Jesse revealed his "weepons" as he called them.</p>

<p>"Did you see anybody on the road ahead?"</p>

<p>"Not for sum miles. I met four ugly lookin' customers
this mornin'. They looked like they might
'a been hoss-thieves theirselves. D&mdash;n the hoss-thieves!"</p>

<p>"Thieves are plenty now-a-days. They come into
towns and break banks in open daylight. How far
did you say the four men were ahead?"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't say, but it must be more'n two
hours since I met 'em, an' they were a ridin' purty
fast, an' I've rid my hoss almost down, as you can
see."</p>

<p>"What kind of looking men were they?" asked
the robber hunters.</p>

<p>"Well, one was a sizable man, with long, red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
beard, an' a flopped black hat on, aridin' on a big
chesnut sorrel hoss, an' one more was a smallish
man, with very black hair and beard, and sharp black
eyes, an' he was a ridin' on a roan hoss, an' another
was an oldish man, with some gray among his beard,
an' he wore a blue huntin' shirt coat, an' he was a
ridin' a gray hoss, and the last feller was a little
weazle-faced chap, with tallowy complexion, who
didn't ware no beard, an' he rode on a dark brown
hoss."</p>

<p>The two robber hunters then consulted together.
"That's their description," said one. "Precisely,"
said the other. "Shall we follow?" asked one. "I
would like to," replied the other. "But there are
four of them," was the remark in rejoinder. "Yes
that is bad. If Ed, Dick and Will would just hurry
up. Those fellows are no doubt very dangerous
men," was the comment of one. "You bet they
are," was the response.</p>

<p>All this time Jesse had listened as an interested
party. Now he thought he was privileged to make
an inquiry.</p>

<p>"What's up, strangers, anyhow?" Jesse asked.</p>

<p>"You blow it! Don't you know that the Corydon
bank, up in Iowa, was robbed yesterday."</p>

<p>Jesse opened his eyes in well-feigned surprise.
"You don't say so!" he ejaculated.</p>

<p>"Yes, in broad daylight, and the men you met are
the robbers, no doubt. There's a big reward offered
to catch them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
"What's this country a comin' to, anyhow? Hoss
thieves down on the Noderway, an' bank rogues up
to Iowa. 'Pears like hard workin' honest folks can't
get along much more."</p>

<p>"Could you go back with us?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to, but the cussed hoss thieves will get
away. Besides, you see, my hoss is mighty nigh
played out hisself. Howsumever, I might ride with
you as fur as I can. D&mdash;n all thieves, say I, don't
you?"</p>

<p>And Jesse actually turned around with the two
pursuers of the robbers, in pursuit of another posse
of pursuers which Jesse had been enabled to accurately
describe by having seen them pass him while
lying snug in a dense thicket.</p>

<p>"They might catch the robbers, an' as he'd hev a
sheer ov the reward, it would be better'n nothin' at
all fur his stolin hosses."</p>

<p>For some miles he kept company with the robber
catchers, until his horse becoming lame, and Jesse
getting near a railway station, rendered further pursuit
of bank robbers distasteful to him, and as his
excuse was received as valid, he bid his late traveling
companions an enthusiastic adieu, boarded a
night train, and was in the vicinity of home next
morning. Those were Jesse's courting days.</p>

<p>The writer of these pages has been informed by a
reputable citizen of St. Louis, that at a time when
the detective forces of both St. Louis and Chicago
were out in the western part of the State, hunting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
for the James Boys and Younger Brothers, that he
saw and conversed with Jesse James on the corner
of Fifth and Chestnut streets, St. Louis, and that on
that occasion Jesse attended the opera, Max Strakosch's
troupe being then in the city. Of course
Jesse James was not the name the people called him
by, but he was to all seeming Mr. William Campbell,
a most respectable shipper of cattle from Wichita,
Kansas. As Mr. Campbell, he had business relations
with many of the citizens, who esteemed him
as "a very clever gentleman." At that time, according
to the statement of the gentleman upon whose
authority this incident is given, Jesse remained in
St. Louis a number of days. His associations were
excellent, and he was a visitor on 'Change, and ventured
even into the Four Courts building, in company
with a well-known citizen, who was, of course,
ignorant of his true name and character. It is believed
that during this trip he made banking arrangements,
and that the Boys now carry a heavy bank
account in some St. Louis bank. Of course this
business is transacted under assumed names.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="small">THE CORYDON RAID.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Thus far no arrests had been made of the plunderers
of the banks at Russellville, Kentucky; Gallatin,
Missouri, and Columbia, Kentucky. Boldly the brigands
had ridden, and skillfully they had executed
their purpose, and, we may almost say, peacefully
they rode away when their deeds were done. At
first, people knew not what to think of these daring
daylight raids. The best detective skill was placed
at fault in ferreting out the haunts of the robbers.
Russellville and Gallatin are separated by many
hundreds of miles. Could the robbers of the former
possibly be the raiders into the last-named place?
And Gallatin is far removed from Columbia; was it
possible that the murderers and robbers at the first-named
place were the same persons who astonished
the people, murdered the cashier and plundered the
bank at Columbia? People asked these questions,
and no one was found able to answer them. Scarcely
had the people ceased to talk, and the excitement
incident to the bold raid on Columbia, with its concomitant
horror, died away, ere the country was
shaken by the recurrence of a similar daring outrage
in another state.</p>

<p>It was the old story repeated. This time a flourishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
town in Iowa was selected for the scene of
exciting events. In Corydon there was, and there
still is, a bank. In that town a considerable amount
of business is transacted, and it was a season of the
year&mdash;June 28th, 1873&mdash;when much of the capital
usually employed in mercantile transactions&mdash;it was
reasonable to infer&mdash;was held in reserve by the bank,
and the raiders calculated on a large prize to compensate
for the risk taken. Certainly the men who went
to Corydon were trained in the same school in which
the Russellville, Gallatin, Columbia and Northfield
robbers were at one time pupils. Riding into town
in daylight, when the inhabitants were out and
abroad pursuing their usual avocations, the thoroughly
armed and well-mounted desperadoes proceeded
to the bank. Three of them dismounted,
drew their pistols, and entered the office. Taken
entirely by surprise, the cashier and two other gentlemen
who were present, could offer no resistance.
In fact, the memory of Gallatin, and the fate of poor
Captain Sheets, came back to them with painful distinctness.
They were paralyzed before the dark
chambers of the huge dragoon pistols, and could not
even so much as protest against the proceedings.
They yielded to the inevitable.</p>

<p>The horsemen who remained in the street ordered
all citizens to retire to their houses, and, with fearful
imprecations, threatened to blow the heads off those
who manifested the slightest hesitation in obeying
their commands. Meanwhile, the bandits on the inside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
were exercising their pleasure with the assets of
the bank. The safe was opened and its contents
raked into a sack which the robbers carried along.
During the progress of their labors in "taking in"
the valuables of the institution, one of them, who
seemed to have been deputied to stand guard over
the persons found in the place, amused himself by
jesting at their distress, and cheerfully asserting his
ability to pick the buttons off their coats with pistol
bullets. The robbers remained but a few minutes.
The citizens were becoming aware of what was
transpiring in their midst, and were recovering from
their surprise, and rallying to contest with the robbers.
With great oaths they bade the people in the
bank to remain perfectly quiet until they were gone,
forced them to the door while they retired, regained
and mounted their horses, and, shouting loudly, they
rode rapidly away, and were out of town many minutes
before any one was ready to go in pursuit.
They were pursued afterward, but none were captured.</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="small">THE CASH BOX OF THE FAIR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Fair time! Kansas City was gay with flags and
streamers and banners. It was a holiday season.
The streets were thronged and trains from Leavenworth
and Sedalia, and St. Joseph and Moberly, and
Lawrence and Clinton and regions further removed
from Kansas City, brought crowds of men, women
and children to see the show. It was a lovely October
day. The temperature was mild, and the sun
shone through an atmosphere which tinged his rays
with gold.</p>

<p>All day the great crowd surged and circled about
the grounds and through the textile hall, and the
art gallery, and the agricultural exhibition, and
among the fat kine and the lazy swine, the sheep and
the horses, and the poultry coops. It was a good
day, so the "management" thought, one of the very
best they had ever had. Shrewd mental arithmeticians
declared there was not a soul less than twenty
thousand visitors present that day, and an incident of
some importance has placed it forever out of the
power of any one to disprove the statement of the
mental arithmetician. The management, too, from
that day to this, have been unable to count the gate
money. Why not we now proceed to tell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
The people visiting the fair were deeply interested
in "the speed and bottom" of sundry "blooded
horses" which were making time around the race
track. The sun was getting low in the west. It
was the last "ring" to be exhibited that day. Of
course no one would think of paying their entrance
fee and go away without seeing the races.</p>

<p>While the great multitude was so engaged, there
was a commotion near the entrance gate. The level
beams of the declining sun cast gigantic shadows
over the ground. A sudden clattering of horses,
hoofs on the beaten road aroused the guardians at the
gate. What could it mean? The noise came nearer.
The guardians looked up. A strange sight met their
gaze. A band of well mounted, well armed, strange,
weird looking men, seven in number, dashed up to
the gate. Among some of the spectators it was supposed
that these singularly brigandish looking men,
were simply actors, that they had been employed by
the "management" for the entertainment of the
visitors to the fair&mdash;that it was, in short, an irruption
of the "Cowbellions," or some such mystic order of
men. Even the treasurers in their "cuddy boxes"
did not comprehend the character of the movement.</p>

<p>But they were not kept in doubt long. Riding
directly to the receiver of money, who, like Matthew,
of saintly memory, was sitting at the receipt of customs,
two of them sprang to the ground, drew
their pistols, and rushed up to the cashier. With a
fearful threat they commanded him to remain quiet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
and designate the money box. What could he do?
Instantly the other robber seized the cash-box. The
men who still remained mounted covered the retreat
of the two who did the seizing. They remounted,
fired a volley as a warning, and dashed away with the
receipts of the day, probably $8,000 or $9,000.</p>

<p>There were twenty thousand people, they said, on
the ground. And yet in the sight of all these the
brigands had done this thing, and were galloping
away unmolested. There were hundreds who saw
them, and if any old Guerrilla comrade was one of
them, and recognized Frank and Jesse James, and
Cole and Bob Younger, they said nothing about it.</p>

<p>As soon as the "management" of the fair and the
police authorities, and sheriffs, and constables, and
marshals had time to think and consider the necessity
for energetic measures in efforts to capture the
brigands, there was mounting in hot haste of police
officers, marshals and other enforcers of the law, and
pursuit was commenced with great vigor. But the
pursuers had little better success than those who went
after young Lord Lochinvar when he eloped with the
bride of Netherby Hall, whom "they never did see."
The pursuers of the robbers of the gate did hear
of a man who was riding along a country road in Clay
county who looked as if he might have been a robber,
but the robbers they never did see.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is, the robbers rode away
about five miles over the hills, until they came to a
piece of wild forest country, rode into the woods;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
came to a sequestered glade; struck a light; emptied
the cash out of the box; counted and divided the
spoils; remounted their horses, and favored by the
darkness of the night, and their thorough knowledge
of the country, they went their way, every man
choosing his own route. Jesse and Frank James
made a visit to the east part of Jackson county to see
some friends, and Cole and Bob Younger, passing
down to the neighborhood of Monegaw Springs, to
visit Mr. Theodoric Snuffer and others of their friends
and relatives.</p>

<p>A great many people did not believe that the James
Boys and Younger Brothers had anything to do with
this robbery, or had ever had anything to do with
any robbery at that time. But there is now no longer
a doubt that the Boys enjoyed the good in this life
which the receipts at the fair ground gate could procure
for them.</p>

<p>An incident in connection with the robbery at the
fair ground gate is of sufficient interest to bear reproduction
here. As we have before related, the
robbery took place while the attention of the people
was deeply engrossed in the horse races then in progress
on the track. That day Mr. Ford, a well
known journalist of Kansas City, was acting treasurer
at "the pool stand." There was a sum of money in
the box amounting to between $8,000 and $9,000.
Mr. Ford was seated upon the box when a couple of
strangers came along. One of them approached the
treasurer, and entered into a conversation about as
follows: The stranger remarked,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
"You must have considerable money in there?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," responded Mr. Ford. "There is a
considerable amount of cash in here."</p>

<p>"Suppose the James Boys should come and demand
it; what would you do?" asked the stranger.</p>

<p>"Well, they would have to fight for it," replied
Mr. Ford. "They might kill me, but somebody would
have to be killed before they could get this box away,
that is certain."</p>

<p>"You would fight for it, eh?" responded the
stranger.</p>

<p>"That I would," said Mr. Ford.</p>

<p>"If you knew it was the James Boys who made
the demand?" asked the stranger.</p>

<p>"Certainly I would," replied Mr. Ford.</p>

<p>The stranger gazed sharply at the treasurer of
"the pool stand" for an instant, and, turning about,
walked away without further remark.</p>

<p>Mr. Ford had met Frank James before, on some
occasion, and was convinced that the person who
addressed him was no other than Frank James. He
recognized him beyond a doubt before he had passed
out of sight.</p>

<p>That evening the robbery was consummated.
Other respectable parties saw Frank and Jesse James
that day about Kansas City, but for a time they were
able to beguile the public into the belief that they
were not present on that occasion. But time has
furnished sufficient evidence to connect them with
that daring enterprise.</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="small">STE. GENEVIEVE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Ste. Genevieve! To many it calls up sweet memories,
and in many hearts the name is sacred and
holy. The very words sound as if full of gentleness,
and love, and purity. And yet, in the very
midst of the Ste. Genevieve of Missouri, acts of
wickedness have been committed which from, their
very nature, startled the whole people of the West.</p>

<p>Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, is an old, old town.
More than a century ago it was a beacon light of
civilization, in the midst of the vast wilderness then
called the "far West." And the people of Ste.
Genevieve are quiet and sedate, and still preserve,
with the traditions of the venerable past, the grand,
courtly ways inherited from their ancestors from the
banks of the Rhone and the Saone. When spring-time
comes, Ste. Genevieve is redolent with the
perfumes of many flowers, and when the sun climbs
higher toward the northern parallel, Ste. Genevieve
reposes amid gardens of summer roses. Why
should brigands dare place their unhallowed feet on
the dust in these ancient streets? If they were not
brigands, they would have loved to inhale the perfumed
air of the old gardens. But being brigands,
they preferred to handle the gold which the fathers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
of some generations of men commenced to hoard.
And for this cause they came to Ste. Genevieve.
Brigands are not a sentimental race of beings.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning, May 27th, 1873, was lovely, as
such spring days are, when the sun is bright, and the
flowers blooming, and the air balmy. Mr. O. D.
Harris, cashier of the bank known as the Ste. Genevieve
Savings Association, being a gentleman of fine
sensibilities, thought so as he sniffed the delicious
aroma of the perfume-laden air, when he wended his
way to the bank, and so he said to his friends who
saluted him by the way. Arriving at the bank&mdash;it
was just about the hour of opening&mdash;he was joined
by young Mr. Rozier, a son of General Firman A.
Rozier, then president of the bank. As Mr. Harris
was about to enter the bank office, his attention was
momentarily engaged by the appearance of two men
who were walking on the street in front of the building,
and looking up at it with an intense interest.
They were just passing it, when suddenly they
turned, and came back as though they intended to
enter. They approached the steps and commenced
to ascend them, preceded by Mr. Harris, who, having
reached the front office, started at once to go
behind the counter. He had not progressed half the
distance when he was suddenly arrested by a harsh,
authoritative command:</p>

<p>"Stop! Surrender, d&mdash;n you!"</p>

<p>Of course Mr. Harris stopped, but could not turn
round, because the fellow who had given the command
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
had two pistols, with muzzles against his
temple.</p>

<p>The other fellow presented a pistol at the head of
young Rozier, and called out:</p>

<p>"You keep still, you d&mdash;d little rat, if you don't
want to die in an instant."</p>

<p>"I? for what?"</p>

<p>"Not another word, young chap! That's enough!
A blabbing tongue can be stopped d&mdash;d easy."</p>

<p>Fearing to remain, and impelled by a sudden and
overpowering desire to take his departure, young
Rozier sprang down the steps, near the landing of
which he was standing, and fled swiftly from the
place. As he ran away, the fellow fired at him, the
bullet cutting its way through his coat on the shoulder,
and just grazing his person.</p>

<p>A neighbor across the way saw the robber with
his pistols at the cashier's head, and started to get
his gun. Just at that moment the other robber fired
at Mr. Rozier, and the wife of the neighbor, seeing
the predicament of Mr. Harris, dissuaded her husband
from attempting to fight them, because she
feared resistance would inevitably lead to the shooting
of Mr. Harris. Young Rozier, after his escape,
gave the alarm to the citizens, who at once began
preparations to make an attempt to capture the bold
marauders.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Harris, without arms, was helpless,
and could only comply with the demands of the
robbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
"Open that safe!" thundered out one of them.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir. I cannot do otherwise," said Mr.
Harris. The safe was opened.</p>

<p>By this time the other robber, who had pursued
young Rozier, joined his comrade in the bank. A
money package, containing upwards of $3,600, was
secured. Then the thief took the coin box, containing
between three and four hundred dollars, principally
in gold. By this time the town was aroused,
and men began to move toward the bank. The robbers
had no time to waste. Turning to Mr. Harris,
they emphatically commanded:</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n you, come with us!" Mr. Harris obeyed.
What else could he do?</p>

<p>When they had gone about fifty yards along the
street, they turned to the little knot of women and
boys collecting about the bank building, and
shouted:</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Sam Hilderbrand!" and continued
to move rapidly away. Two hundred yards from the
bank they came to two other men equally well
armed, and all having superb horses, who awaited
their coming. Here, perceiving that Mr. Harris
wore an elegant gold watch, one of the robbers took
it from him, and transferred it to his own person.</p>

<p>Then all four of the men started to get on their
horses. Just at that time one of the horses got loose
and ran off. A German farmer, in a wagon, happened
to be passing. Him they compelled, under the most
dire threats of immediate extermination, to go after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
the horse. The German caught the horse and
brought him back to where the robbers still held
Mr. Harris. Then they all mounted and rode rapidly
away, not forgetting to fire a salute at the crowd of
citizens who had started in their direction. By this
time fully a dozen citizens had armed themselves, and
taking horses, were ready for pursuit. They followed
the robbers rapidly, and soon came up with them.
But it was at once evident that the four men were
desperadoes, who would not submit to arrest. They
fired at the pursuing posse, and compelled them to
fall back. Then the whole population turned out,
and went in pursuit. But they never came up with
them, and soon lost even the trail which they followed.</p>

<p>Some miles from Ste. Genevieve the robbers met
a farmer going toward the town. They informed
him that he would find something valuable, which
belonged to the bank, in the road ahead of him.
In accordance with their statement, the farmer found
the empty coin box and a lot of papers scattered
about. The robbers had taken away a number of
valuable papers belonging to the sheriff and others,
for which they had no use, and these they had considerately
thrown away.</p>

<p>This was one of the boldest robberies which had
ever taken place at that time in the West. The
"Ste. Genevieve Savings Association" building was
situated in the most populous part of the town of
Ste. Genevieve, with a population of about three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
thousand souls. The street through which they
passed to reach the bank was the most traveled
thoroughfare in that part of the country. It happened
in broad daylight, when all the people of the
village were engaged about their ordinary concerns.</p>

<p>Of course a deed like this was calculated to create
a sensation. The citizens of Ste. Genevieve pursued
the bandits, but lost them, and even all traces of the
route which they had taken. What could be done?
That was the question.</p>

<p>Mr. Harris went up to St. Louis on the 28th of
May to see the police authorities in that city. General
Rozier, at that time a State Senator, and on
duty at Jefferson City, as a member of the State
Board of Equalization, was advised of the robbery,
and went down to St. Louis to confer with Mr.
Harris and the Chief of Police. Then the hunt was
commenced, and prosecuted with a great show of
vigor for a time. Theories as to who the robbers
were appeared in the public journals almost every
day. Some said it was Sam Hilderbrand&mdash;who was
not known to be dead then&mdash;and his gang of desperadoes;
some said that it was Cullen Baker's crowd
from Arkansas; others thought it might possibly
be the James Boys and Younger Brothers who "put
up the job," but were far from satisfied that they
"were the lads who did it." In those days there
were a vast number of very respectable people who,
while admitting that Frank and Jesse James, and Coleman
and James Younger, were dangerous men, so far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
as taking the life of fellow-beings was concerned,
would at the same time repel any insinuations that
they might possibly raid a bank or flag a train. No,
they were too honorable and honest for that sort of
business. While the people were discussing these
questions, the band, of which the James Boys were
the leading spirits, was enjoying life on the spoils of
Ste. Genevieve.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="small">A RAILWAY TRAIN ROBBED IN IOWA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"Robin Hood and his merry men," of Sherwood
forest fame, have left a name indelibly written on the
pages of history. In the days of our youth we have
heard or read about Claude Duval and Jack Shepherd,
and their wonderful exploits in old England;
and we have a faint recollection of one John A. Murrell,
who obtained great distinction as an outlaw in
the Southern section of our own country. The
Harps who infested the passes of the mountains of
East Tennessee were celebrated robbers in their
days. And that shrewd mongrel of the commingled
blood of old Castile and a red daughter of the western
wilds, Agatone, the terror of the Rio Grande
border, made no little noise in his day as a daring
brigand. But neither these nor the celebrated Fra
Diavola were like the brigands we are speaking
about.</p>

<p>William de la Marck, the outlawed nobleman of
the low countries, and known in history as "The
Wild Boar of Ardennes," plundered by the wholesale.
There was nothing little or mean in his methods.
He would scorn to pounce upon a lonely traveller
and demand his purse. He sacked villages and
plundered caravans. In this our Missouri outlaws
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
resemble "The Wild Boar of Ardennes." They do
not wait in gloomy places to catch a single wayfarer;
they do not meet a weary traveller on the highway
and cry out to him, "Your money or your life!"
They would despise such petty meanness.</p>

<p>After Ste. Genevieve they rested. But their season
of repose was not long. A new campaign was
planned. Hitherto they had depredated on the
banks. But they were about to commence another
line of business. The whole question was, no doubt,
discussed with profound interest in their secret conclave.
Such a thing as plundering a railway train
was something new. The public mind had not become
accustomed to read accounts of the arrest of
railway trains and the robbery of the passengers by
a band of armed robbers. The Missouri bandits
thought to create a sensation.</p>

<p>In the early part of July, 1873, Frank James, Cole
Younger, Robert Moore, a desperado from the Indian
Territory, Jesse James and Jim Younger, held a
conference in Jackson county, Missouri, when a
scheme was broached to overhaul and rob a railway
train. The first suggestion was to rob a train on the
Hannibal &amp; St. Joe. railway, or some other road in the
state of Missouri. But that was rejected after due
deliberation. The plan of going into Iowa was suggested
and met with favor. The plans were matured
before the gang separated. About the 14th of the
month the robbers met at the house of a friend in
Clay county, and the final arrangements were made;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
a place of rendezvous was appointed, and the gang
then separated into couples. As usual, Frank and
Jesse James took the same route; Cole Younger and
Bob Moore another, and Jim Younger and a Texas
desperado who went by the name of Commanche
Tony, followed another route. The robbers leisurely
pursued their journey, and on the 20th of July they
were near the line of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp;
Pacific railway, about fourteen miles east of the city
of Council Bluffs. At the appointed place of rendezvous
they all meet after dark, on the night of the
twentieth. During that day Jesse James and Cole
Younger made a reconnoissance, and selected the exact
spot to carry out the enterprise in which they
were engaged. It was agreed that they would
"throw" the morning train bound east from Council
Bluffs, as it was supposed to carry a large amount of
specie <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> east from the Pacific slope. The
robbers didn't care much for silver, but they were
willing to accept all the gold bricks that might fall
into their hands. The place selected was about three
miles from the rendezvous, in the edge of a belt of
timber, and where the road bed was in an excavation
about four feet deep. The train was due at that
point about three o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>With deliberate purpose the robbers took their
station in the underbrush near the track. Several
cross ties were placed in a position to be immediately
utilized when the time came. Three or four rails
were loosened from the ties, and in silence the bandits
waited for the approach of the train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
In due time the train was descried by the watcher
at the upper end of the curve&mdash;the road was very
straight for a long distance to the west of the place
selected. At that point there is a rather sharp curve
and an obstruction placed on the track could not be
seen by the engineer until he was within sixty yards
of it. As soon as the train was seen coming down
the long straight track, the robbers suddenly awoke
into life and activity. The loosened rails were thrown
apart, and half a dozen cross ties were thrown across
the tracks just above.</p>

<p>The engineer saw the danger when too late. He
reversed his engine, but the momentum was too
great. The ponderous locomotive plunged on,
struck the obstruction, and careened on the side of
the track. The shock was terrific. The engineer
was killed and the fireman seriously injured. But
the train stood still. The aroused passengers had no
time to inquire the cause of the sudden stoppage.
They knew full soon. The presence of armed men&mdash;strange,
weird, desperate&mdash;appearing on the platforms
of the coaches informed them concerning the
situation. The train passed into the hands of bandits.
The passengers were ordered in a peremptory
manner to keep still. The command was accompanied
by dreadful threats of instant annihilation on
the least evidence of disobedience. Surprised and
unnerved by the suddenness of the attack, the passengers
obeyed. Then three of the band proceeded
through the train and commanded the passengers to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
surrender up their money and their jewelry. They
made a searching examination of each person in the
cars. It is understood that several thousand dollars
were obtained in this way. The express and mail car
were searched and rifled. The spoils of the examination
were put into a sack, and the robbers sought
their horses, and mounting, speedily galloped away.</p>

<p>Of course the intelligence of such an occurrence
was telegraphed far and wide. A most determined
pursuit of the robbers was at once organized and set
on foot. The sheriff of the county in which the
robbery was committed summoned a large posse of
men and started in pursuit. His theory was that
they were Missouri outlaws. He got on the trail of the
robbers, and tracked them through western Missouri
as far as St. Clair county. Here he lost their trail,
and efforts to find the outlaws proved unavailing.
The sheriff finally gave up the chase and returned
home.</p>

<p>It is proper to add that friends of Cole Younger
denied that he could possibly have had anything to
do with this robbery. They assert that he was at the
Monegaw hotel, St. Clair, on Sunday morning, the
20th of July, and therefore could not have been in
Iowa the next morning. But there is no doubt that
the Youngers&mdash;at least Bob and Jim&mdash;were present
with the Jameses on that occasion. At any rate,
the bandits escaped with their booty.</p>

<p>They used to say that the James Boys and the
Younger Brothers might kill men who attempted to
impose upon them, but they would not rob or steal.
Those who rob men of life must be the greatest
criminals, and the lesser crimes are included in the
greater. The career they had chosen required the
service which money alone can render. These men
had need for money which their legitimate resources
were inadequate to supply. Those who have taken
many lives will not hesitate long to take a few dollars
when their necessities require it. Such are the laws
which govern human actions.</p>

<p>Long before many of the very respectable citizens
of Clay, Clinton and Jackson counties believed it, the
sons of the excellent minister whom they had
known were the most unscrupulous and daring highwaymen
who had ever followed the roads on this
continent. The Jameses early became the most
dangerous outlaws of which history gives us any account.
They were bold, but cautious; skilled in the
school of cunning; trained in the art of killing;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
shrewd in planning, and swift in the execution of
their designs.</p>

<p>They seldom attempted a robbery except in out-of-the-way
places where the presence of robbers
was not expected. Nor did they ever attempt robberies
a second time at the same place. Their plan
was to strike unexpected blows. This week they
would rob a train at Gad's Hill, next week at Muncie,
Kansas; again, they would arrest a stage on the
Malvern and Hot Springs road, and then again they
would flag a train at Big Springs, Wyoming Territory,
a thousand miles from the scene of their last
exploit.</p>

<p>It was a gray, raw day in January, 1874, when the
regular stage running from Malvern, on the St.
Louis, Iron Mountain &amp; Southern Railway, to Hot
Springs, pulled out from the little town. Two ambulances
for the accommodation of the afflicted
pilgrims bound for that Mecca of relief,
accompanied the stage on the road. This
cavalcade had reached the romantic vale of the
Golpha, near the old Gains' mansion. This is a
narrow dell, shut in by abrupt hills, clad with a
dense forest of pine and tangled underbrush and
evergreen vines. At this particular place the valley
widens, and there is a beautiful farm and lovely
grounds bordering the roadside on the east and north
side of the stream. West and south the deep, tangled
forest crowns the hills, which rise to a great
height. Here is a favorite halting place for travelers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
along that way. The clear waters of the Golpha
afford refreshing draughts to the wearied teams.</p>

<p>We have said it was a gray, raw morning in January.
The long drive from Malvern over the stony
roads inclined the passengers, as well as the horses,
to rest. That particular Thursday morning the
drivers had stopped, as usual, directly opposite the
Gains residence, which is about two hundred yards
from the road, toward the northeast. The spot is
about five miles southeast from Hot Springs. A
little beyond the stopping place the road crosses the
stream at a ford. Beyond the creek the country is
very rugged, and covered with forest trees. And in
those trees a band of robbers were crouched, waiting
the approach of the stage and ambulances. The unsuspecting
pilgrims were soon moving on, inwardly
congratulating themselves on the near termination of
their fatiguing journey.</p>

<p>The stage and ambulances had proceeded well
into the wood on the Hot Springs side of the Golpha,
perhaps half a mile from "the watering place,"
when a strong, emphatic voice called out from the
borders of the brush: "Stop! d&mdash;n you, or
I'll blow your head off!" Thus commanded, of
course the driver of the stage brought his team to a
standstill. The passengers naturally threw aside the
flaps of the vehicles and thrust out their heads to
ascertain what the strange proceedings meant. They
saw at once. Cocked revolvers yawned before them,
and stern, harsh voices exclaimed in chorus, "D&mdash;n
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
you, tumble out!" "Certainly, under the circumstances,
we will do so with alacrity," replied one of
the passengers, a Mr. Charles Moore. "Raise your
hands, you d&mdash;d&mdash;&mdash;." Of course every passenger
promptly obeyed the order. One passenger, a rheumatic
invalid, alone, was left undisturbed. Then the
leader cried out:</p>

<p>"Come! be quick, form a circle here!"</p>

<p>The order was obeyed. Then two of the robbers,
one of whom was armed with a double-barrel shot-gun
and the other with a navy repeater, mounted
guard over the prisoners, and made many sinister remarks,
doubtless intended to be jocose, but which
kept the prisoners in a tremor of apprehension all
the while.</p>

<p>Then two of the brigands proceeded to examine
the effects and pockets of the passengers.</p>

<p>When the affable gentlemen of the road had completed
their undertaking, they proceeded in the coolest
manner imaginable to cast up their accounts.
They had lost in cash&mdash;nothing; in jewelry&mdash;naught;
in conscience&mdash;well, it happened they didn't have
any to lose. They had gained from sundry passengers
as follows:</p>

<p>It was a very good morning's work, and the bandits
were so well pleased that they were inclined to
indulge in a sort of grim facetiousness. One of them
unharnessed the best stage horse, saddled him and
mounted him, and after trying his gait by riding up
and down the road a few times, called out:</p>

<p>"Boys, I reckon he'll do!"</p>

<p>Another one of the band went to each passenger
as he stood in the circle. John Dietrich was the
first to pass through the ordeal of cross-examination.</p>

<p>"Where are you from?"</p>

<p>"Little Rock," replied Dietrich.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!"</p>

<p>"Yes, have a boot and shoe store there," remarked
Dietrich.</p>

<p>"You'd better be there attending to it," was the
observation of the chief of the bandits.</p>

<p>"Are there any Southern men here?"</p>

<p>"I am," replied Mr. Crump and three others.</p>

<p>"Any who served in the army?"</p>

<p>"I did," said Crump.</p>

<p>The leader then asked him what regiment he belonged
to, and what part of the country he had
served in. The answers were satisfactory, and then
the robber handed Crump his watch and money, remarking
as he did so:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
"Well, you look like an honest fellow. I guess
you're all right. We don't want to rob Confederate
soldiers. But the d&mdash;d Yankees have driven us all
into outlawry, and we will make them pay for it yet."</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor, of Lowell, Mass., was examined.</p>

<p>"Where are you from?"</p>

<p>"St. Louis."</p>

<p>"Yes, and d&mdash;n your soul, you are a reporter for
the St. Louis <cite>Democrat</cite>, the vilest sheet in the land.
Go to Hot Springs and send the dirty concern a telegram
about this affair, and give them my compliments,
will you?"</p>

<p>Then Governor Burbank felt encouraged to ask a
favor of them.</p>

<p>"Will you please return me my papers?" asked
the Governor. "They are valuable to me, but I am
sure you can make no use of them."</p>

<p>"We'll see," said the leader, sententiously, and
took the packet and kneeled down to examine them.</p>

<p>In a few moments he took up a paper with an official
seal, that excited his ire, and before he paused
to examine it sufficiently to enable him to determine
its character, he reached the conclusion that the
bearer was a detective, a class which he held in the
utmost hatred.</p>

<p>"Boys, I believe he's a detective&mdash;shoot him, at
once!" was the sententious command. In an instant
Governor Burbank was covered by three ready
cocked dragoon pistols. The ex-Governor was on
the border of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
"Stop!" cried the robber, "I reckon it's all right.
Here, take your papers."</p>

<p>And the ex-Governor felt that a mighty load had
suddenly been lifted from him, and that a dark
cloud, which but a moment before had enshrouded
the world in the deepest gloom of midnight, had
drifted away, allowing the bright sun to shine out on
the scenes of time.</p>

<p>The passenger from Syracuse asked for the return
of $5, to enable him to telegraph home for assistance.</p>

<p>The chief looked at him rather sternly for a few
moments, and said:</p>

<p>"So, you have no friends nor money. You had
better go and die. Your death would be no loss to
yourself or the country. You'll get nothing back, at
any rate."</p>

<p>All this while one of the robbers, said to have been
James Younger, held a double-barrel shot-gun cocked
in his hand, which he pointed ever and anon at Mr.
Taylor, the supposed <em>Democrat</em> reporter, making such
cheerful remarks as these: "Boys, I'll bet a hundred
dollar bill I can shoot his hat off his head and not touch
a hair on it." And the others would respond with a
banter of a very uncomfortable character, while the
facetious bandit went on: "Now, wouldn't that button
on his coat make a good mark. I'll bet a dollar
I can clip it off and not cut the coat!" With such
grim jests did he amuse himself and torment the
captive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Having thoroughly accomplished their work, the
bandits made the drivers hitch up their teams and
drive away. The whole transaction was completed
in less than ten minutes. The robbers did not
linger. In a few minutes they scattered through the
brush. Some "struck out," as they expressed it,
for the Nation, another for Texas, and one for
Louisiana.</p>

<p>Of course, denials of complicity on the part of
the Jameses in this affair were at once entered by
their friends. But it has since been ascertained that
the party who did the deed consisted of Frank and
Jesse James, Coleman and James Younger, and Clell
Miller, one of the associates of the daring outlaws.</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="small">GADSHILL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>During the morning of January 31, at the hour of
9:30 o'clock, the St. Louis and Texas express train,
with a goodly number of passengers, and the mails
and valuable express freight, departed from the
Plum street depot in St. Louis, bound for Texas, via
the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern railroad.
Mr. C. A. Alford was the conductor in charge of the
train when it departed, and when the event which
we are about to describe occurred.</p>

<p>Gadshill, a name rich in historical associations, is
a lonely wayside station on the road, situated in the
northeast corner of Wayne county, Missouri, about
seven miles from Piedmont, which is the nearest telegraph
station.</p>

<p>The 31st of January, 1874, was a dreary, winter
day. The cold gray clouds veiled the sky, and no
ray of sunlight filtered through the wintry pall.</p>

<p>The day wore away, wearily enough, with the passengers
on Mr. Alford's train. They had not yet
been together a sufficient length of time to assimilate,
and each one was left to his, or her, own device
for amusement or entertainment. Slowly the hours
passed away. The landscape was cold, dreary and
forbidding; the winds came blowing from the north
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
with a chill in their breath that made the passengers
think longingly of "sweet home." Iron Mountain,
and Pilot Knob, and Shepherd's Mountain, and the
beautiful valley of Arcadia, in their winter dress,
wore anything but a pleasing aspect. In fact, it was
a comfortless sort of day, which made the passengers
feel anything but merry.</p>

<p>Nightfall was approaching. Already the thick atmosphere
was becoming sombre in hue, and it was
evident the curtains of darkness were falling over
the earth.</p>

<p>By this time it was about 5:30 o'clock in the afternoon.
The train was approaching the little station
dignified by the name of Gadshill, in honor of
the locality where Sir John Falstaff so valiantly met
the Buckramite host, an event graphically delineated
by the historian and poet of all climes and times.
As the train drew near, the engineer saw the red flag
displayed, and whistled "down brakes."</p>

<p>Before proceeding to relate what happened to the
train and the passengers on it, we shall state what
had happened at Gadshill before the train came.</p>

<p>About half-past three o'clock that afternoon, a
party of seven men, splendidly mounted and armed
to the teeth, rode to the station, secured the agent,
then took in a blacksmith, and afterwards all the citizens
and two or three countrymen, and one lad,
who were waiting for the arrival of the train. Among
the persons so detained was the son of Dr. Rock, at
that time Representative in the Legislature from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Wayne county. The captives were taken to the
little station-house and confined there, under the
surveillance of one of the armed robbers. Then the
bandits set about completing their arrangements for
executing the work which they had come to perform.
The signal flag was displayed on the track and the
lower end of the switch was opened, so that the
train would be ditched if it attempted to pass. Then
the bandits waited for their prey.</p>

<p>In due time the train came dashing down the
road. The engineer saw the flag and gave the signal
for stopping. Mr. Alford, the conductor, was
ready to step upon the little platform as soon as the
train came alongside. The robbers did not show
themselves until the cars were at the station. No
sooner had the train come to a full halt than Mr. Alford
stepped off to the platform. He was instantly
confronted by the muzzle of a pistol and greeted with
the salutation:</p>

<p>"Give me your money and your watch, d&mdash;n your
soul! quick!"</p>

<p>Mr. Alford had no alternative. He gave up his
pocketbook containing fifty dollars in money, and an
elegant gold watch.</p>

<p>"Get in there!" they commanded, and Mr. Alford
obeyed.</p>

<p>While this was going on, one of the brigands had
covered the engineer with a revolver, and compelled
him to leave his cab. Meanwhile, part of the band
occupied the platforms at the ends of the passenger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
coaches, while two of them went through the train
with a revolver in one hand and commanded the
passengers to give up their money. Of course the
defenseless travellers yielded their change to the
uttermost farthing into the hands of the robbers.</p>

<p>Mr. John H. Morley, chief engineer of the St.
Louis, Iron Mountain &amp; Southern Railroad, was
among the passengers, and was plundered along with
the rest of them. The robbers made a clean sweep,
taking money, watches and jewelry from all. Among
the passengers robbed, were Silas Ferry, C. D.
Henry, Geo. G. Dent, Mr. Scott, Sr., Mr. Scott, Jr.,
Mr. Lincoln, Mr. Meriam, O. S. Newell and A. McLain.
After having effectually stripped the passengers
of worldly wealth, the robbers proceeded to the
express car, broke open the safe, and secured the
contents. The mail bags were next cut open and
their contents rifled of everything of value. The
whole amount of money secured by the robbers was
somewhere between eight and ten thousand dollars.
After completing their work the bandits went to Mr.
Alford and remarked that as he was conductor he
needed a watch, and they gave him back his timekeeper.</p>

<p>When they had satisfied themselves that there was
no more plunder to be gained, they released the conductor
and engineer, and told them to draw out at
once.</p>

<p>As the robbers, whose part of the business it was
to relieve the passengers of their spare cash, passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
through the cars, they asked each one of the gentlemen
passengers his name. One of the victims, a Mr.
Newell, asked the brigands,</p>

<p>"What do you want to know that for?"</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n you, out with your name, and ask questions
afterward!" was the profane reply.</p>

<p>"Well, my name is Newell, and here's my money,
and now I want to know why you ask me for my
name?" said Mr. Newell, with an attempt at pleasantry,
fortified by a sort of grim smile.</p>

<p>"You seem to be a sort of jolly coon, anyhow,"
said the robber, "and I'll gratify you. That
old scoundrel, Pinkerton, is on this train, or was to
have been on it, and we want to get him, so that we
can cut out his heart and roast it."</p>

<p>During the time they were in the cars among the
passengers, they mentioned the name of Pinkerton
many times, and exhibited the most intense hatred
of the distinguished detective. It was very fortunate
for Mr. Allan Pinkerton that he was not a passenger
on the train that lumbered up to the dreary station
of Gadshill that winter day.</p>

<p>This circumstance is confirmatory of the evidence
that Jesse and Frank James were leaders in the
Gadshill affair. They, for years, have cherished the
most bitter animosity toward the detective, and the
very mention of his name was sufficient to render
them almost frantic with rage.</p>

<p>The citizens were released, and the robbers
mounted their horses and rode away in the gathering
darkness, over the forest-crowned hills to the west.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Some of the features of this bold robbery were
ludicrous in the extreme. The trepidation of the
passengers made the job a quick one, because they
were ready on demand to give up everything to the
freebooters. One passenger complained at the
hardship, and the following dialogue ensued:</p>

<p>"Give me your money, watch and jewelry, you
blamed cur! quick!"</p>

<p>"Now, please, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dry up, d&mdash;n you, and shell out!" And the
robber thrust a pistol against his temple.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Excuse m-m-me, p-p-p-please, d-don't
shoot. Here's a-all I've g-got in t-t-the world." And
the poor fellow, all tremblingly, handed up his
wealth.</p>

<p>"I'm a good mind to shoot you, anyhow," remarked
the robber, "for being so white livered."</p>

<p>At this the alarmed traveller crouched down behind
a seat.</p>

<p>It was nightfall when the robbers rode away.
Gadshill is in the midst of a wilderness country.
There are but few settlements among the hills, and
it was impossible to organize an effective posse at
once for pursuit. At Piedmont, on the arrival of the
train, the news was telegraphed to St. Louis and Little
Rock. The citizens of that vicinity were aroused,
and before midnight a well armed posse of a dozen
men were riding over the hills westward in pursuit.</p>

<p>But the robbers, who were all mounted on blooded
horses, rode swiftly away. Before the dawn of day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
they were sixty miles from the scene of the crime.
They called at the residence of a widow lady named
Cook, one mile above Carpentersville, on the Current
river, to obtain a breakfast. There were but five of
them in the party, and these were each armed with
a pair of pistols and a repeating rifle. They continued
on, and passed Mr. Payne's on the Big Piney, in
Texas county, and went to the house of the Hon.
Mr. Mason, then a member of the State Legislature,
and who was at that time absent attending its session,
and demanded food and lodging from Mrs. Mason.
They remained there all night, and proceeded westward
in the morning. The same day that the five
men took breakfast with Mrs. Cook, a dozen pursuers
from Gadshill and Piedmont arrived at the same
place, having tracked them sixty miles.</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="small">AFTER GADSHILL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The bold act of brigandage at Gadshill aroused
the whole country. The outlaws had become formidable.
Missouri and Arkansas were alike interested,
and the citizens of both states were ready to
make personal sacrifices to aid in the capture of such
daring brigands. But who were the robbers? A
question not easy to answer with any assurance of
correctness. Some said at once that it was the
Jameses and the Youngers and their associates.
Geo. W. Shepherd, one of Quantrell's most daring
Guerrillas in Missouri, and one of those who separated
from him when he went to Kentucky, was an
intimate friend of the Jameses in the old Guerrilla
times. After the war Shepherd emigrated to Kentucky
and married at Chaplin, Nelson county, where
he settled down. After Russellville, circumstances
pointed to him as one of the persons implicated in
the robbery. He was arrested, carried to Logan
county and tried. The proof was of such a character
that he was found guilty of aiding and abetting
the robbers, and was sentenced to the penitentiary
for a term of three years. At the expiration of his
sentence he returned to Chaplin and learned that
during his incarceration his wife had obtained a divorce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
and married another man. Shepherd had paid
$600 on the house and lot which he found his ex-wife
and husband occupying. But he left them there and
took his departure from Kentucky. At the time of
the Gadshill affair he was somewhere in Missouri.
But there is not a particle of evidence to connect
him with the robbery.</p>

<p>Bradley Collins was a noted desperado in those
days, who figured in Texas and the Indian Territory
as one of the worst outlaws in the business. He also
rode at times with the Jameses and the Youngers.
John Chunk was another daring outlaw who infested
Texas and the Indian Territory, and often came into
Missouri and co-operated with the brigands of that
state.</p>

<p>Sid Wallace, afterwards hanged at Clarksville,
Arkansas, was another noted outlaw between the
years 1866 and 1874. He, too, was a "friend" of the
Jameses. Cal Carter, Jim Reed, John Wes. Hardin,
Sam Bass, Bill Longley, Tom Taylor and Jim Clark,
all notorious in Texas and the Nation, often joined
the Missouri outlaws and hunted with them. Indeed,
it appears that there was a regularly organized band
of brigands ramifying through the states of Missouri,
Kansas, Colorado, Arkansas, the Indian Territory
and Texas. This banditti was composed of the most
desperate and daring men who had ever placed
themselves beyond the pale of the law in this
country.</p>

<p>Whatever doubts might once have existed concerning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
the personality of the bandits of Gadshill,
they have all vanished in the light of subsequent
events. Jesse and Frank James, some of the Youngers
and their associates, were undoubtedly the men
who rode to Gadshill. The fellows seemed to have
had a bit of classical humor in their composition in
selecting a place so named as the scene of such an
exploit.</p>

<p>It seemed to have created a conviction in the minds
of those in authority, also, that the Jameses were the
leaders. Governor Woodson, of Missouri, offered a
reward to the full extent of the law's provisions.
Governor Baxter, of Arkansas, communicated to
Governor Woodson his desire to aid in the capture
of the outlaws, and also offered a reward. The express
company offered a heavy reward for the capture
of the bandits, and the United States authorities
took an active interest in the movement set on foot
to break up the formidable banditti. Stimulated by
the prospect of gain, the detectives all over the
country became active in the pursuit. The citizens,
too, were on the move, and it seemed that the auguries
all pointed to a speedy annihilation of this formidable
gang which infested the West.</p>

<p>Meanwhile another outrage was committed almost
on the line of retreat from Gadshill, which still
further agitated the public mind.</p>

<p>During the afternoon of the 11th of February,
1874, five men, splendidly mounted and well armed,
rode into the town of Bentonville, Benton county,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Arkansas. Their entrance was quiet. They rode
to the store of Craig &amp; Son; dismounted and entered
the store; made prisoners of the proprietors and
clerks at the muzzle of pistols, and proceeded to rifle
the cash box. Fortunately for the firm of Craig &amp;
Son, they had made a deposit that day and the robbers
only obtained about one hundred and fifty dollars
in money. They helped themselves to about
one hundred dollars' worth of goods; warned the
proprietors and clerks not to give the alarm until
they had passed out of town; went out; mounted
their horses and rode away in the most nonchalant
manner. In a saloon adjacent, there were more than
twenty men who were uninformed as to what was
taking place in the store of Messrs. Craig &amp; Son, until
after the robbers had departed. Pursuit was made,
but the bandits escaped.</p>

<p>The weeks following the Gadshill outrage were
busy ones with the detectives. A carefully planned
campaign against the marauders was at once instituted
and prosecuted with great vigor. Allan Pinkerton,
the American Vidocq, was employed by the
express company to hunt the robbers down. The
United States Government ordered the Secret Service
force into the field, and the police and constabulary
forces of Missouri and Arkansas, under orders
from the Governors of the respective states, were acting
in concert with the forces of detectives called
into service by the General Government and the express
company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
The brigands were successfully tracked through
the wilds of southern Missouri, and their trail led
into the hill country of St. Clair county, and across
Jackson county on beyond the Missouri river. No
doubt was left upon the minds of the man-hunters as
to the personalty of the Gadshill robbers. The
James Boys and some of the Youngers were certainly
engaged in it. The Youngers, at least John
and Jim, had returned to Roscoe, St. Clair county,
"flush with cash." The detectives were on their
tracks. To the force was added Ed. B. Daniels, a
courageous young man of Osceola, who was thoroughly
acquainted with the country. The detective
force in St. Clair county was under the direction of
one of Allan Pinkerton's picked men, Captain W.
J. Allen, whose real name was Lull. With him was
a St. Louis "fly cop," well known, and distinguished
for his shrewdness and daring, who for the time had
assumed the name of Wright. Daniels was extremely
serviceable as a guide.</p>

<p>One morning, when near the residence of Theodoric
Snuffer, a short distance from Roscoe, these
three men were suddenly surprised by John and
James Younger, who rode up behind them in the
road. They were at Snuffer's house, and saw the
detectives pass, and started out with the avowed purpose
of capturing them. Approaching the three
men in the rear, they raised their double-barrel shot-guns,
and with an oath commanded them to hold up
their hands and drop their pistols. Taken thus, at a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
disadvantage, the detectives complied, and dropped
their belts of pistols in the road. James Younger
dismounted to secure them, while John remained on
horseback with a double-barrel gun covering them.
For a moment he lowered his gun. That moment
was fatal. Captain Lull drew a concealed Smith &amp;
Wesson revolver from his bosom, and fired. The
ball took effect in John Younger's neck, severing the
left jugular vein. In the very agonies of death, as
he fell from his horse to die, John Younger raised a
pistol and fired, the ball taking effect in the left arm
and side of Captain Lull. Two more shots were
fired, probably by James Younger, before Allen, or
rather Lull, fell. James Younger then commenced
firing at Ed. B. Daniels. That gentleman also had a
concealed pistol, returned the fire and inflicted a
slight flesh wound on the person of James Younger.
But his fate was sealed. A fatal bullet crashed
through the left side of the neck, and Daniels fell,
and soon afterward expired. This tragedy excited
and alarmed the whole country. It was no longer
possible for James Younger to remain in the country.
He took the pistols which his dead brother,
John, had worn, and departed for the house of a
friend in Boone county, Arkansas, where he was
soon joined by Cole and Bob.</p>

<p>Wright, who was riding a short distance in advance
of Captain Lull and Ed. Daniels, hearing the summons
of the Younger Brothers, turned, and at a
glance saw the situation, and, putting spurs to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
horse, dashed away. Although he was fired upon
and pursued a short distance by James Younger, he
managed to escape unharmed, aided as he was by a
very fleet horse.</p>

<p>The hunters for the Jameses met with no better
luck. One of the darkest tragedies which ever disgraced
the state of Missouri followed the efforts of
the detectives to capture the shrewdest and most
daring outlaws who have yet appeared in this country.
There is an air of mystery about this terrible
episode which makes it all the more thrilling. The
full details of this crime are reserved for another
chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="small">WHICHER'S RIDE TO DEATH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The James Boys were believed to have been the
projectors and leaders of the Gadshill enterprise.
Soon after that event they returned to Clay county.
Traces of their trail through Southern Missouri were
soon discovered. The description given of two of
the five travellers who took breakfast at Mrs. Cook's
on Current river, and lodged at Mr. Mason's house
in Texas county, answered well for Frank and Jesse
James. The detectives caught at every clue. The
James Boys were at Gadshill beyond a doubt. And
so the brigand hunters passed into Clay county.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the James Boys and other members of
the gang were resting in the vicinity of Kearney, in
Clay county, at the residence of Dr. Samuels.
Among those known to have been there were Jim
Cummings and Clell Miller, Jim Anderson, a brother
of Bill Anderson, of Centralia notoriety, and Bradley
Collins, a Texas desperado. The sheriff of Clay
county thought Arthur McCoy was probably at that
time with the Jameses. On the 9th day of March,
Jesse James spent a portion of the day in Kearney.
The gang had several horses shod a few days before
at a country blacksmith shop in that vicinity.</p>

<p>Wednesday, March 10, 1874, arrived at Liberty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
the county seat of Clay county, Missouri, J. W.
Whicher, from what place it mattered not to the citizens
of Liberty. This man was in the very vigor of
a matured manhood. He was just twenty-six years
of age, lately married to an estimable and accomplished
young lady, a resident of Iowa City.</p>

<p>Whicher was intelligent, shrewd and daring. He
was selected by his chief, Allan Pinkerton, who is
acknowledged as a consummate judge of human
nature, as the fittest instrument to execute the most
dangerous enterprise which he had ever yet undertaken.</p>

<p>Immediately on arriving at Liberty, Whicher
called at the Commercial Savings Bank to see Mr.
Adkins, its president. To him he made known his
errand into that section. At the same time he deposited
in the bank some money and papers. Mr.
Adkins was not able to give Whicher all the information
which he desired, and sent him to Col. O. P.
Moss, ex-sheriff of Clay county, for further information.</p>

<p>When he opened his plans to Moss, that gentleman
advised him not to go. He gave him a terrible
account of the prowess of the desperadoes; told
him of their shrewdness and of their merciless nature
when excited by the presence of an enemy,
and warned him that he need not hope to secure
such wary men by stratagem. Col. Moss was earnest
in his efforts to dissuade Whicher from making
the rash attempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
But it was of no avail. Whicher had received
what he regarded as positive evidence that the
Jameses were the leaders of the Gadshill bandits,
and, further, that they were now at home, near Kearney.
Stimulated by the hope of "catching his
game," and securing the large rewards, Whicher,
who seems to have been destitute of any sense of
fear, made his arrangements to go that very evening
to the Jameses' place of retreat. Disguised in the
garb of a farm laborer, with an old carpet bag swung
on a stick, Whicher took the evening train for Kearney,
and there made inquiries for work on a farm. He
did not tarry long at the station, but soon started out
toward the Samuels place.</p>

<p>Poor Whicher! he little thought that his fate was
already determined upon by those whose destiny he
was seeking to determine. But so it was.</p>

<p>There was a friend of the Jameses in Liberty that
day&mdash;a fellow named Jim Latche, who had been expelled
from Texas on account of his worthless qualities
as a citizen and dangerous attributes as a criminal.
Latche had met the James Boys, and had
made a raid with them, on one occasion, down in
Texas. He had been resting at their retreat for a
few days, and was probably on a scout for them that
day. At any rate, he was in Liberty when Whicher
arrived. He observed his movements, because
Whicher was a stranger; saw him go to the bank
and make a deposit; waited while he conferred with
Mr. Adkins, and then, tracked him to Col. Moss'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
office. He came to the conclusion that Whicher
was a detective; and when afterward he saw that
the detective had changed his clothes, he was convinced
that he was right. Latche hastened away to
give a report of what he had heard and observed.</p>

<p>When Whicher arrived at Kearney the Jameses
knew of it, and suspected the truth concerning his
mission. It was in the evening. Jim Anderson,
Jesse James and Bradley Collins were in waiting on
the roadside, about half a mile from the Samuels
residence. Soon after Whicher came along. He
was carrying a carpet-sack. Jesse James came out
of their concealment alone, and met Whicher in the
road.</p>

<p>"Good evening, sir," said Whicher.</p>

<p>"Where in h&mdash;ll are <em>you</em> going?" responded the
other.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a rude response, but I will not answer
as rudely again. I am seeking work. Can you tell
me where I can get some work on a farm?"</p>

<p>"No, not much, you don't want any, either, you
d&mdash;d thief. Old Pinkerton has already given you a
job that will last you as long as you live, I reckon."</p>

<p>And Jesse laughed a cold, hard laugh that meant
death. Of course Whicher was helpless, for the
other had him under cover of a pistol from the moment
he came in sight. But Whicher was dauntless
and wary, and, without exhibiting the least trepidation,
he said:</p>

<p>"Who do you take me to be? What have I to do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
with Pinkerton or his business? I am a stranger in
the country and want something to do. I don't see
why you should keep that pistol pointed at me. I
don't know you, and have never done you any
wrong."</p>

<p>"Oh, d&mdash;n it, you are the kind of a dog that
sneaks up and bites, are you? You will carry in the
James Boys, will you? You are a nice sneaking cur,
ain't you? Want work, do you? What say you, my
sneak? Eh?"</p>

<p>The tantalizing manner of Jesse James did not
disconcert the detective. He answered these taunts
with perfect coolness:</p>

<p>"I don't understand you, sir. I am no cur, and
know nothing of the James Boys. I addressed you
politely, and you did not return the same. I said I
wanted some employment, and you taunt me for it.
I must bid you good evening."</p>

<p>With this, Whicher made a step forward. His
progress was arrested by the harsh voice of Jesse
James.</p>

<p>"You shall die if you move out of your tracks!
Keep up your hands!"</p>

<p>Whicher realized by this time that his chance of
escape was small, for he knew that Jesse James stood
before him, and he had quickly made up his mind
that he would sell his life dearly. He was cool, active
and expert with the pistol; his right hand was
almost involuntarily seeking to grasp his weapon.
But Jesse James evidently had him at a great disadvantage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
Instantly realizing this, he changed his
purpose.</p>

<p>"Well, this is a singular adventure, I declare.
Now, why you should make such a mistake concerning
me is more than I can imagine. You are surely
making sport of me. I tell you I know nothing of
the persons of whom you speak, and why should
you interrupt me? Let me go on, for I must find a
place to stop to-night, anyhow."</p>

<p>Jesse James laughed outright. "What," said he,
"were you doing at Liberty to-day? Why did you
deposit money in the bank? What business did you
have with Adkins and Moss? Where are the clothes
you wore? Plotting to capture the James Boys, eh?"
and Jesse laughed aloud, and Jim Anderson and
Fox, another confederate of the Boys, came from
their concealment, with pistols in hand. Poor
Whicher saw this, and for the first time he fully realized
the helplessness of his position.</p>

<p>"Betrayed," he thought, almost said.</p>

<p>Jesse James said, in a cold, dry tone: "Young
man, we want to hear no more from you. We know
you. Move but a finger and you die now. Boys,"
he said, addressing Anderson and Fox, "I don't
think it best to do the job here. It wouldn't take
long, but for certain reasons I don't think this is the
place. Shall we cross the river to-night?" The others
answered they would, if it was his pleasure.</p>

<p>All this time Whicher had stood still; not a muscle
moved, and not a single wave of pallor had covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
his features. He knew what they meant by
"the job," and made up his mind to improve any incident,
however slight, to have revenge on his murderers.</p>

<p>But there were no favorable incidents for him. He
had been tried and condemned in a court from
which he could not appeal. At what time the sentence
would be executed he could not tell.</p>

<p>"Boys, relieve him of his burden and weapons,"
said Jesse James.</p>

<p>Quick as thought, Whicher's hand was thrust into
the bosom of his coat. It was too late. Fox and
Anderson sprang upon him, while Jesse James placed
the muzzle of his pistol against his temple. To
struggle was useless. He was compelled to yield,
for just then Brad Collins and Jim Latche joined
the others. The case of the detective was hopeless.
In an instant they had disarmed him; he had brought
only one Smith &amp; Wesson pistol. Then the desperadoes
felt of his hands, and laughed at his pretensions
as a farm-laborer.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_180.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>Whicher Meets His Fate.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Confident in the belief that he had been betrayed
by one of the two gentlemen to whom he had applied
at Liberty, Whicher made up his mind that he
would make no whining petition to the murderers.
If he had known the exact state of the case he
would not have gone to Kearney, and if he had gone
he would have been better prepared to encounter the
Boys. But fate had ordained it otherwise, and another
victim to the long, long catalogue of names
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
which Jesse James had written in blood was the outcome
of it all.</p>

<p>Darkness had fallen upon the fair scenes of nature
while these things were happening. The cool March
winds whistled dismally through the yet naked forest
trees. The stars came out and looked coldly from
the empyrean, but there was purity in their beams,
and no blood marks on their twinkling discs. It was
meet that the tragedy which was about to take place
should be enacted in the hours of gloomy night, and
at a time when all without was comfortless and
dreary.</p>

<p>Whicher was bound securely, and a gag was
placed in his mouth that he might call for no aid or
deliverance. The desperadoes placed hum upon a
horse, in the still hours of the night, and rode away.
His legs were tied securely under the horse's belly,
and his arms were pinioned with strong ropes. Jesse
James, Bradley Collins and Jim Anderson were
the executioners. In silence himself, Whicher, during
that long, lonely ride heard the three discussing
their bloody deeds with a thrill of horror, for they
had told him what his fate was to be.</p>

<p>About three o'clock on the morning of the 11th
of March, the drowsy ferryman at Blue Mills, on the
Missouri river, was roused to wakefulness by the
shouts of men on the north side, who signified their
desire to cross over.</p>

<p>"Be in a hurry," cried the belated travelers. "We
are after horse thieves and must cross quick if we
catch them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
Thus appealed to the ferryman crossed the river
to the northeastern shore, where the horse thief hunters
awaited him.</p>

<p>When they came down to the boat, they said to
the ferryman:</p>

<p>"We have caught the thief, and if you want to
keep your head on your shoulders you had better
put us across the river very quick."</p>

<p>So persuaded, the ferryman obeyed. They were
soon on the south side of the river. The ferryman
observed that one of the men was bound and gagged.
It was poor Whicher on his way to his execution.
The very stars shone piteously through a veil of
mist, and the winds sighed sadly as the strange
group moved off on the Independence road. But
neither the helpless condition of their victim, nor the
sad aspect of nature in the solemnity of the hours of
darkness could evoke a spark of pity in the sered
hearts of Whicher's executioners.</p>

<p>They rode away in the darkness. Just how they
executed their purpose only the red-handed outlaws
and the merciful God knows.</p>

<p>The next morning an early traveler on the road
from Independence to Blue Mills, about half way between
the places, in a lonely spot, saw a ghastly
corpse with a bullet-hole through the forehead and
another through the heart. It was all that remained
of Whicher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="small">A NIGHT RAID OF DETECTIVES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>After Whicher's melancholy fate, Allan Pinkerton
had motives aside from those of gain for pursuing
to the death the celebrated border bandits,
Frank and Jesse James. In one year, three of the
most courageous and trusted men in the employ of
the distinguished detective had been sent out after
the Missouri outlaws, and were carried back cold in
death, after conflicts with the desperadoes. Whicher
and Lull and Daniels were asleep in gory beds.
And yet Frank and Jesse James, and their followers
and allies, were free as the winds that blow, to come
and go as interest or caprice might dictate to them.
While this condition of affairs continued, Pinkerton
must have felt that his reputation as a skillful entrapper
of criminals suffered.</p>

<p>About the first of the year 1875, the great detective
commenced a campaign against the renowned
brigands which was meant to be finally effective.
The most elaborate and careful preparations were
made. Nothing was left undone which could in any
way contribute to the success of the undertaking.
The utmost secrecy was observed in every movement.</p>

<p>Several circumstances seemed to favor the detectives.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Many of the most respectable citizens of
Clay county had grown weary of the presence in
their midst of persons of the evil reputation of the
Jameses, and entered with alacrity and zeal into the
scheme inaugurated for the capture of the Boys.
Among those of the citizens most prominent in the
movement which had for its design the annihilation
of the band of which Jesse James was supposed to
be the chief leader, were several of the old neighbors
and acquaintances of the James and Samuels
families.</p>

<p>With these citizens, Mr. William Pinkerton, who
had gone from Chicago to Kansas City, to direct
the movements of the detective forces, opened communication.
A system of cipher signals was adopted,
and communications constantly passed between the
different persons engaged in the undertaking. The
citizens in the neighborhood of Kearney were watchful,
and keenly observed every movement in the
vicinity of the residence of Dr. Samuels, and daily
transmitted the results to their chief, who had established
temporary headquarters at Kansas City.</p>

<p>It was known to some of the immediate neighbors
of Dr. Samuels that Frank and Jesse James were at
home. They had been seen occasionally at the little
railway station of Kearney, which is three miles distant
from the residence which had been, and was
still claimed, as the home of the outlaws. Near
neighbors, in casually passing, had seen them about
the barnyards. All these things had been faithfully
reported to the chief detective at Kansas City.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
At length the opportune time for striking a decisive
blow was deemed to have arrived. Dispatches
in cipher were sent to Chicago for reinforcements,
and specific orders touching their movements after
their arrival near the objective point, were given.
The Kansas City division of the forces was held in
readiness to co-operate with the force from the East.
The citizens of Clay county, who had so zealously
aided the detectives, received final instructions as to
the part they were to take in the grand <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</i>, by
which their county was to be forever relieved of the
presence of the dangerous outlaws.</p>

<p>Extraordinary precautions had been taken to
maintain a profound secrecy as to the movements
and purposes of the detectives. No strange men
had been seen loitering about Kearney. Everything
which could possibly be done to allay suspicion on
the part of the outlaws had been done. But the
Jameses had friends everywhere in Western Missouri&mdash;keen,
shrewd, vigilant men, who noted everything,
and whose suspicions were aroused by the slightest
circumstance. The very quiet which prevailed was
ominous of approaching danger. Somehow, too,
they had learned of the sending and receiving of
cipher messages by a Clay county man, at Liberty.
This made them doubly watchful.</p>

<p>The extensive preparations which had been made,
and the necessity imposed upon them of waiting for
a suitable opportunity to strike, had occupied much
time, and it was not until the night of the 25th of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
January, that the detectives made the final attack.</p>

<p>Jesse and Frank had been seen near the Samuels
place that very evening, and no doubt was entertained
that they were at home.</p>

<p>The detective forces destined for the attack on
what was facetiously termed "Castle James,"
were divided into small squads, and began to
arrive in Clay county on the afternoon of the 24th,
from the East. Coming after night, they were met
by citizens of Clay county and conducted to places
of shelter in the most quiet and secret manner.
After nightfall on the evening of the 25th, a special
train came up by Kearney, and on it came another
detachment from Kansas City. These were met by
citizens well acquainted, and conducted to the place
of rendezvous.</p>

<p>Secretly as these movements had been conducted,
the ever-vigilant Jesse had his suspicions aroused by
some trivial circumstance, which would have escaped
the attention of almost any other man. Convinced
that some formidable movement was going on, designed
to consummate his destruction, Jesse James,
his brother, and another member of the band rode
away from the Samuels house after nightfall that
very evening, and at the hour when the detectives
arrived in the vicinity of the place where they expected
to capture them, the Jameses were riding in
the cold, well on their way to the house of a friend,
miles away.</p>

<p>The detectives had no intimation that their intended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
victims had taken the alarm and departed
from the place. They were assured that the outlaws
had been seen in the vicinity of their home at a late
hour in the afternoon, and it was believed that they
were there still.</p>

<p>The night was cold and dark. It was late&mdash;perhaps
near midnight, when the detective force arrived
at the farm-house. There were nine men selected
from Pinkerton's force because of their shrewdness
and courage, and several citizens of the vicinity who,
like the detectives, were fully armed. The assailing
forces took up their stations completely surrounding
the house. Some balls of tow thoroughly saturated
with kerosene oil and turpentine had been prepared,
and the detectives carried with them some formidable
hand-grenades to be used in the assault. Two of
the assailants approached a window at the rear of
the house. The slight noise made in opening the
shutters and raising the sash aroused a negro woman,
an old family servant, who was sleeping in the apartment.
She at once set up a shout of alarm which
speedily brought to the room Mrs. Samuels, her husband,
and several members of the family, some of
them young children.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_188.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>Night Attack on the Samuels Residence.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Just then a lighted ball of tow and oil was
thrown into the room. The place was instantly
brilliantly illuminated. The inmates of course, having
just been aroused from slumber, were greatly
agitated at this unexpected assault. The situation
was truly appalling. Another lighted ball was hurled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
into the room. The younger members of the family
cried out piteously as they fled aghast from the lurid
flames that shot toward the ceiling. Mrs. Samuels
quickly recovered her presence of mind, and began
to give directions and personally to exert herself in
the work of subduing the flames. She was permitted
only a moment to engage in this employment.
There was a sudden crash as a great iron ball struck
the floor, followed in an instant by a terrific explosion.
Instantly the room was filled by a dense cloud
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
of smoke, through which the white flames of the fireballs
gleamed with a lurid red hue as if tinged with
blood. There was a wail of agony from within that
pandemonium of midnight horrors which might well
have called emotion to a heart of stone. The piteous
moans of childhood in dying throes, were mingled
with the deeper groans of suffering age, and the
shriller cries of terrified youth. The work of the
assailants in that particular line of attack was complete.
And yet the noted outlaws did not appear.
It was at once concluded that they were not present
or they would have shown themselves under such
circumstances. The attacking force did not wait to
ascertain the result of the explosion of their terrible
missile. They realized only that the game they
sought had escaped them, and they retired from the
place without caring to learn anything more about
the consequences of their effort. They had failed,
and that was all they felt interested in ascertaining.</p>

<p>When the smoke had cleared away and the fires
which had been kindled about the house were extinguished,
the extent of the execution done by the
explosion was fully revealed. The spectacle presented
was awful beyond any power of our pen to
describe. There, lying on the floor, in a pool of
blood, poured out from his own young veins, was the
mangled form of an eight-year old son of Mrs. Samuels,
in the very throes of death; Mrs. Samuels' right
arm hung helpless by her side, having been almost
completely torn off above the elbow. Dr. Samuels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
was cut and bruised; the aged colored woman was
wounded in several places; in fact, every member of
the household was more or less injured. Blood was
everywhere. Death was in the room; and pain and
grief combined smote upon every soul in that stricken
home.</p>

<p>Whatever the crimes of the boys of ill-favored
reputation, they afforded no justification for this terrible
assault in which innocent childhood was made
the victim for the deeds of others. And the people
of the state, without any exceptions, condemned the
deed as wholly unjustifiable. The detectives made
haste to leave the country, and the citizens who had
assisted them returned to their homes and kept counsel
with themselves.</p>

<p>The dead boy was taken away, and in his little
grave under the snow they left him lying, the sinless
victim of sin, over whose untimely fate many hearts
have swelled with emotions too big for utterance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="small">PROPOSED AMNESTY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>There can be no doubt that there was a heavy
undercurrent of popular opinion in favor of the James
Boys, generated by a conviction that they were the
victims of cruel and uncalled-for persecution, brought
upon themselves by their adhesion to a cause which
was dear to the hearts of many thousands of the
citizens of Missouri. Their later deeds were forgotten,
while their former acts were remembered with
admiration. Though the evidence seemed clear,
which connected the Jameses and Youngers with innumerable
daring robberies, yet many hundreds of
good people refused to credit the reports, and offered
their sympathy to the men whom they believed
to be victims of vile slanders and unwarrantable
persecutions.</p>

<p>The sympathy openly manifested for the boys
came not from the reckless and vicious elements, but
from influential persons all over the state. As late
as 1875, there were thousands of respectable people
in Missouri who had no sympathy with the movements
set on foot by the legal authorities for the apprehension
of the desperadoes, simply because they
did not believe them to be robbers, and that the
killing done by them was a justifiable punishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
inflicted on ancient enemies who richly deserved their
fate.</p>

<p>The effect of the raid on the residence of Mrs.
Samuels, the mother of Frank and Jesse James, was
to create a diversion in favor of the boys. The
tragedy of that event was of so horrible a nature,
that public sentiment set in strongly against any
further attempt to capture the boys by force. There
was a strong sentiment in many quarters of the state
in favor of trying a policy of conciliation toward the
desperadoes. The reasons advanced in favor of this
policy were numerous, and some of them possessed
some weight. It was alleged that the state had already
suffered the loss of considerable sums in pursuing
them; that it was extremely doubtful whether
their capture could ever be effected; that in consequence
the good name of the state must be tarnished;
that while the Jameses and Youngers were declared
to be, and treated as outlaws, other bad men would
commit crimes and shift the responsibility to the
outlawed men; that the course pursued toward the
Jameses and Youngers was a species of persecution,
and finally it was plead that all this persistent hunting
of these men was stimulated by the animosities
of enemies, dating from the war time, and inasmuch
as the United States Government had granted amnesty
to its enemies for acts committed during the
continuance of hostilities, that it was not right the
state of Missouri should pursue with vindictive persecution
any of its citizens for acts committed during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
the war, and their friends contended that the outlawry
of these men grew out of their course in the
period between 1861 and 1865.</p>

<p>These views and opinions in respect to the Jameses
and Youngers assumed a formal shape in the early
part of March, 1875, by the introduction in the Legislature
of Missouri by the late General Jeff. Jones,
then a member of the House of Representatives
from Callaway county, of a bill, or preambles and
resolution, offering amnesty for all past offenses to
Jesse W. James, Thomas Coleman Younger, Frank
James, Robert Younger and James Younger, on the
condition that they should return to their homes and
quietly submit to such proceedings as might be instituted
against them for acts alleged to have been
committed by them since the war.</p>

<p>The preambles and resolution offered by General
Jones received the approval of Attorney-General
John A. Hockaday, and of many other lawyers of
acknowledged ability. General Jones supported the
measure with great zeal and earnestness, and no little
ability and eloquence.</p>

<p>As this measure was one of great importance to
the subjects of this volume, we deem it necessary to
give the essential parts of the document, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote2">
<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, By the 4th section of the 11th Article of the Constitution
of Missouri, all persons in the military service of the United States, or
who acted under the authority thereof in this state, are relieved from
all civil liability and all criminal punishment for all acts done by them
since the 1st day of January, A. D., 1861; and,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, By the 12th section of the said 11th Article of said Constitution,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
provision is made by which, under certain circumstances,
may be seized, transported to, indicted, tried and punished in distant
counties, any Confederate under ban of despotic displeasure, thereby
contravening the Constitution of the United Slates and every principle
of enlightened humanity; and,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, Such discrimination evinces a want of manly generosity
and statesmanship on the part of the party imposing, and of courage
and manhood on the part of the party submitting tamely thereto; and,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, Under the outlawry pronounced against Jesse W.
James, Frank James, Coleman Younger, Robert Younger and others,
who gallantly periled their lives and their all in the defense of their
principles, they are of necessity made desperate, driven as they are
from the fields of honest industry, from their friends, their families,
their homes and their country, they can know no law but the law of
self-preservation, nor can have no respect for and feel no allegiance to
a government which forces them to the very acts it professes to deprecate,
and then offers a bounty for their apprehension, and arms foreign
mercenaries with power to capture and kill them; and,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, Believing these men too brave to be mean, too generous
to be revengeful, and too gallant and honorable to betray a friend or
break a promise; and believing further that most, if not all the offences
with which they are charged have been committed by others, and perhaps
by those pretending to hunt them, or by their confederates; that
their names are and have been used to divert suspicion from and
thereby relieve the actual perpetrators; that the return of these men to
their homes and friends would have the effect of greatly lessening crime
in our state by turning public attention to the real criminals, and that
common justice, sound policy and true statesmanship alike demand
that amnesty should be extended to all alike of both parties for all acts
done or charged to have been done during the war; therefore, be it</p>

<p><i>Resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate concurring
therein</i>:</p>

<p>That the Governor of the State be, and he is hereby requested to
issue his proclamation notifying the said Jesse W. James, Frank
James, Coleman Younger, Robert Younger and James Younger, and
others, that full and complete amnesty and pardon will be granted them
for all acts charged or committed by them during the late civil war, and
inviting them peaceably to return to their respective homes in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
state and there quietly to remain, submitting themselves to such proceedings
as may be instituted against them by the courts for all offenses
charged to have been committed since said war, promising and
guaranteeing to them and each of them full protection and a fair trial
therein, and that full protection shall be given them from the time of
their entrance into the state and his notice thereof under said proclamation
and invitation.</p>
</div>

<p>The above bill was introduced about the first of
March, 1875, and was referred to the Committee on
Criminal Jurisprudence, of which its author was a
leading member. The bill was fully discussed in
committee, and finally, through the influence of its
author, a majority of the committee agreed to make
a favorable report on the measure to the House of
Representatives. Sometime towards the close of the
session of the 28th General Assembly, the bill came
up for its third reading in the House. General
Jones made an earnest speech in advocacy of the
measure. A member aroused a strong opposition to
the measure from the very side of the house from
which General Jones had hoped to obtain assistance
in carrying it through. The member simply read a
portion of a message transmitted by Governor Silas
Woodson to the 27th General Assembly denouncing
these same outlaws; and the Democratic Legislature
of Missouri refused to pass the bill. Thus the stigma
of outlawry remained upon them, and their hands
were turned against every man.</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
<span class="small">THE SAN ANTONIO-AUSTIN STAGE PLUNDERED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It had been a lovely day. Nature had put on her
richest habiliments of bloom and beauty. The sun
shone with a genial warmth, and the air was soft and
perfume-laden from the thousands of wild flowers
exhaling the rich aroma from the wide prairies. It
was an eminently respectable party who travelled
from San Antonio on the stage that day. There
were in the company the Right Rev. Bishop Gregg,
of the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Texas, and
Mr. Breckenridge, president of the First National
Bank of San Antonio; three ladies, and six other
gentlemen, merchants of San Antonio&mdash;in all, eleven
travellers, well provided with the means to get
through the world without fear of famishing.</p>

<p>The stage was the regular four-horse, United
States mail coach, running in the line between San
Antonio and Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>The respectable party of eleven travellers had as
pleasant a time as the crowded condition of the
stage and the monotonous nature of the scenery
could be expected to afford them. Of course the
bright sunlight made the scenery appear at least
cheerful.</p>

<p>The stage was bowling along the well-beaten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
highway, drawn by four fresh horses, which had
been hitched to it about half an hour before sundown.
They had gone from "the stand" perhaps
as much as four miles, and it was getting quite
dusky&mdash;daylight fading away in the west. The
stage had reached a point about twenty-five miles
west from Austin.</p>

<p>In the gathering gloom, the driver beheld what
appeared to be six rancheros, wearing sombreros,
approaching the road just before him. Such incidents
were not infrequent on that part of the route,
and the appearance of the six men did not at first
create any feeling of disquiet in the mind of the
Jehu. But as the party drew nearer, and he discovered
that they were mounted on splendid "American
horses," and not "mustangs," he thought it very singular,
to say the least of it. He was an old stager
on the plains, and not inclined to be "panicky,"
but he muttered, "I'll sware, them's queer fellers,
anyhow." He did not have time to think very much
about them, for in another moment two of the horsemen
rode alongside the stage, with revolvers cocked,
and commanded, with a great oath, "Halt!"
Of course there was no alternative, for two more
of the robbers had galloped in front of the foremost
span of horses and checked the further progress of
the stage team. The other two robbers had taken
up a position on both sides of the stage&mdash;one at each
post, and were pointing pistols at the passengers,
and with horrible oaths telling them to "tumble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
out" at once, or die. The astonished passengers&mdash;not
even the Reverend Bishop&mdash;were just then ready
to adopt the latter alternative, and very gracefully
descended from the stage.</p>

<p>The passengers were formed into a group, which
included the driver, and two of the bandits, with
drawn revolvers, stood guard over them. The two
horsemen in front dismounted and detached the
lead-span of horses, and with the other two commenced
their search for booty.</p>

<p>The trunks of the passengers were broken open,
and every valuable thing which could be easily carried
away was appropriated. The United States
mail bags were then cut and the letters torn open.
In this part of the stage-load they were quite successful,
securing a large amount of bills in registered
packages. One of the mail-bags was appropriated
as a receptacle for the plunder. Having gone
through the baggage and mail matter, the bandits
turned their attention to the passengers. There was
an animated dialogue carried on for a time, in the
following style:</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen and ladies, allow us to trouble
you for the money and jewelry which you may have
about you."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to rob us?" asked the Bishop.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Don't use such ugly language. We
just want to relieve you of a burden&mdash;that's all, old
sock."</p>

<p>"You don't call that robbery?" asked the Bishop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
"Come, now, old coon! Dry up, or you'll not have
an opportunity to ask any more nonsensical questions.
Hand out your money!"</p>

<p>The Bishop reluctantly complied.</p>

<p>"Now that watch of yours!" they further commanded.</p>

<p>"What! Will you not allow me to keep my
watch. It is a gift and dearly prized. You would
not rob an humble minister of Christ of his timepiece,
would you?" queried the Bishop.</p>

<p>"So, ho! You are a parson then, judging from
the cut of your buckskins&mdash;or a priest&mdash;it makes no
difference. Well, Christ didn't have any watch, and
he didn't ride in stages either. He walked about to
do his Father's will, and wasn't arrayed in fine
clothes, and didn't fare sumptuously every day.
What use has a preacher for a watch? Go and travel
like the Master. Out with that watch! No more
words&mdash;not one, mind you! We are not Christians,
we are Philistines."</p>

<p>The Bishop was constrained to give up his watch&mdash;a
valuable and much prized one.</p>

<p>"Anything more? Out with it."</p>

<p>The Bishop protested that he had nothing more of
value about his person. They, however, made a personal
examination before they were satisfied, one of
them remarking:</p>

<p>"You can't depend on many of these long-faced
canters, anyhow."</p>

<p>Then the robbers searched Mr. Breckenridge, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
from him they obtained a plethoric pocketbook, containing
one thousand dollars, and an elegant gold
watch, and a very valuable diamond pin.</p>

<p>So they went from one to another of the passengers,
until the eight gentlemen of the respectable
party of travellers had been politely plundered.
Then the turn of the ladies came.</p>

<p>"Hand out your pocketbook," said the leader to
the first lady approached.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, here it is," replied the frightened lady,
handing him her money.</p>

<p>The robber took it, opened it, and examined the
contents by the light of the stage lantern. Then he
came back to the lady, and asked if that was all the
money she had. She replied that it was. He then
inquired where she was going. She told him to
Houston.</p>

<p>"Here, madam, take your money. We regret
the trouble we have given you."</p>

<p>So they went to the other two ladies, and from
one they got a watch, some jewelry, and about one
hundred dollars in cash. From another they received
some valuable jewelry, and a considerable sum of
money.</p>

<p>Their work was now completed. During the two
hours they held the passengers under guard, they
sometimes made jesting remarks, and at other times
threatening ones. The least want of alacrity in
obeying their orders was sure to subject the passengers
to the direst threats. The robbers took with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
them the lead-span of horses when they rode away.</p>

<p>The whole amount of cash taken from the passengers
exceeded three thousand dollars, besides several
gold watches, and considerable jewelry of value.
The amount taken from the mail bags was several
hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Who were the robbers? This question was inferentially
answered sometime afterward, when, in a
conflict with a Texas official, Jim Reed, a member of
the gang, was mortally wounded, and confessed
that he was one of the party, and that his associates
were men from Missouri, noted as "brave boys."
Who were so noted on the 7th day of April, 1874,
at which time the stage robbery took place, but
Frank and Jesse James, and the Younger Brothers?
It is now the settled conviction of all who are acquainted
with the facts, that the James Boys were
there and "bossed the job."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.<br />
<span class="small">FARMER ASKEW'S FATE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>During the time General Jone's amnesty measure
was pending in the Legislature of Missouri, Jesse
and Frank James remained very quiet. They even
opened up communication with Governor Charles H.
Hardin and Attorney-General John A. Hockaday,
through Sheriff Groome, of Clay county. From all
the evidence at present available, we are forced to
believe that at this time Jesse and Frank James were
sincerely anxious that the measure should be adopted,
and were in earnest in the desire to conclude a peace
with society with which they had been at war for ten
long years.</p>

<p>For a time their vengeance slumbered. It was
known to them that certain neighbors of theirs in
Clay county had taken an active interest in the efforts
which had been put forth to accomplish their
arrest, and every one expected that a bloody retaliation
would follow. Their conduct had made for
them many enemies in the community of which their
father had been an honored member. Some of these
were open and outspoken in denunciation of their
course, while others were restrained in expressions of
hostility by their knowledge of the desperate and
vengeful character of the men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
But the Jameses knew when to restrain themselves,
and carefully abstained from any act that might lose
to them the effect of the slight revulsion in public
opinion in their favor caused by the tragic results of
the night raid. But they had marked their men&mdash;vengeance
was only delayed. Possibly, if General
Jone's amnesty measure had succeeded, they would
have withheld the hand of destruction, and their
intended victims, instead of mouldering in gory
graves, might to-day be alive. It is impossible to
even conjecture what might have been the effect on
the future life of the daring desperado, Jesse James.
He might have turned away from the evil way which
he had travelled so long, and atoned by an upright
life for all the past. But it was not to be. For to
them&mdash;</p>

<p>They were outlaws still. Hunted as enemies of
their kind, they turned viciously to avenge what
they, no doubt, earnestly believed their wrongs.</p>

<p>Among those who had expressed in strong terms
his disapproval of the conduct of the James Boys,
was Mr. Daniel H. Askew, a well-to-do farmer, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
somewhat prominent citizen of Clay county, whose
farm and residence was near the home of the
Jameses. The outspoken opinion of Mr. Askew had
given great offense to the Jameses and their friends,
and when the night raid was made in January they
at once suspected that Askew had been partly instrumental
in bringing it about. This belief was
strengthened by some of the scouts in the interest of
the Jameses finding a couple of blankets, and evidences
of the late presence of men among Mr.
Askew's haystacks. To still further confirm them
in the belief that Askew assisted the detectives in the
attack on the Samuels house, a young man known
as Jack Ladd, who had been in Askew's employ as
a farmer, departed from the country on the night of
the assault.</p>

<p>It is but justice to the memory of Mr. Askew, to
state in this place that he frequently and earnestly
disclaimed having any knowledge whatever of the
movements of the detectives in the employ of Mr.
Pinkerton. But his denials had no weight with the
vengeful Jameses. They and their friends continued
to believe that the attacking party were sheltered
and led by farmer Daniel H. Askew, and they resolved
to execute dire vengeance upon him.</p>

<p>On the night of April 12th, 1875, Mr. Askew went
with a bucket to a spring some distance from his
residence, and returned to the house with the bucket
filled with water. He had sat the bucket on a bench
and was standing on his back porch, not having yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
entered the house after returning from the spring.
Just in the rear of the house, and within ten paces
of the edge of the porch on which Mr. Askew was
standing, there was a heap of firewood reaching perhaps
to the height of five or six feet. Behind this
wood-heap the assassins found a convenient hiding
place. Whoever they may have been, they had ridden
to the rear of a field, hitched their horses, and
walked through the field to their place of concealment.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_205.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>Death of Farmer Askew.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Suddenly the report of a pistol, followed instantaneously
by the report of two shots, rang out on the
night air, and Mr. Askew fell upon the floor of the
porch and immediately expired. Some members of
the family, in a great state of alarm, rushed out to his
assistance, but found him already dead. Three shots,
evidently fired from heavy revolvers, had taken effect
in the head of the poor farmer, and one had crashed
through his brain.</p>

<p>The murderers had run back across the field,
mounted their horses and departed before the grief-stricken
and astonished family could make any
movements toward discovering their identity.</p>

<p>That night at a late hour some men on horseback
rode by the house of Mr. Henry Sears, and summoned
him to the door. He saw three men in the
road. One of them called to him and said, "We
have killed Dan Askew to-night, and if anyone wants
to know who did it, say detectives."</p>

<p>Having thus delivered their terrible message, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
men rode away in the dark. And the friends and
neighbors gathered to the Askew farm-house to console
his bereaved and stricken family, and the coroner
came next day, "due inquisition to make into
the causes which led to Daniel H. Askew's death."
But from that day to this no one knows to a certainty
who took the farmer's life. The general belief at the
time was, that he had fallen a victim to the vengeance
of the James Boys. The years that have elapsed
have only served to strengthen that belief and deepen
the convictions of those who believed that Askew
died at the hands of the vengeful outlaws. Who can
tell? Only Him who knoweth all things, and the
assassins, if still alive, hold the dreadful secret.</p>

<p>Muncie is a little wayside station on the Kansas
Pacific Railroad, not many miles from Kansas City,
in Wyandotte county, Kansas. The situation, surroundings
and small importance of the place in
other respects, were not calculated to give it a wide-spread
fame; and yet Muncie has become a place of
historic renown, as the scene of one of the most
daring exploits of the most renowned outlaws of
modern times.</p>

<p>It happened one dreary December evening in the
year 1875. On that occasion the programme which
had served at Gadshill was carried out at Muncie.
A band of armed men, well mounted, and keen and
alert, had waited until the east-bound passenger
train on the great thoroughfare between the rich
mines of the West and the centers of commerce in
the East arrived near their chosen lair. The topography
of the region, and other favorable circumstances,
rendered the task one of easy accomplishment,
though it involved an exhibition of daring
which few men care to manifest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
In some way the bandits, of which Frank and
Jesse James were chiefs, had information that a large
amount of silver and gold was in charge of the express
messenger on that train. It has been said that
this information was transmitted to them by Jackson
Bishop, who had been a noted Guerrilla in Quantrell's
command, and who, subsequent to the cessation
of hostilities, had journeyed to the "Far West,"
and entered into business as a mining operator in Colorado.
Be that as it may, one thing is certain, the
knights of the road had information that the express
company had treasures in trust that trip, and these
they were ready to appropriate.</p>

<p>In due time the train approached Muncie. There
was no sign of warning, and when the engine came
to a standstill at the wayside station, in obedience to
a signal, it was immediately taken possession of by
seven men. The engineer and fireman were carefully
guarded. The passengers were admonished and intimidated
by the presence of armed men on the
platforms of the cars, whose formidable pistols
seemed to be pointed at each individual passenger,
and the harsh commands of those men were obeyed
with alacrity by the surprised passengers. But the
robbers were generous that evening. The treasure
in the express car was what they sought. Individual
possessions were as "the small dust" compared
to that.</p>

<p>The express messenger was immediately confronted.
Demands were made upon him with which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
he was compelled to comply. The safe was opened,
and then the robbers proceeded to examine the contents
of that treasure box at their leisure. The
gain was worth the daring. Their reward was <em>thirty
thousand dollars in gold dust</em>. The contents of the
car were further examined, and a large amount of silver
and other valuables were secured.</p>

<p>On this occasion the bandits were content with
the spoils of the express car, which, it is said,
amounted to about <em>fifty-five thousand dollars</em>. The
passengers were, therefore, not subjected to the
manipulations of the robbers.</p>

<p>As usual, the news of this fresh outrage by bandits
was flashed far and wide. The country was
aroused, and in an incredibly short space of time
many bands of men were abroad in all directions,
hunting the robbers. All their efforts proved vain.
The shrewd raiders escaped with their booty.</p>

<p>A few days after the great train robbery at Muncie,
a police officer at Kansas City, in the discharge
of his duty, arrested one Bill McDaniels, charged
with being drunk on the street. When he was
brought to the station and searched, articles on his
person were identified as having been taken from the
express car at Muncie. Every possible effort was
made to induce Bill McDaniels to designate his confederates
in the train robbery. But to every proposition
he was deaf, and finally, in attempting to escape,
he was shot dead, dying without revealing the
name of his confederates. The bandits escaped.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The James Boys have always claimed that they
were driven into outlawry by the very instrumentality
which organized society has employed to subserve
the ends of justice and afford protection to the
rights and liberties of all&mdash;namely, the government.
This claim, made by them, has been partly conceded
by a large class of persons, irrespective of all
political affiliations and social relations. So their
wild career was commenced, and so it has proceeded
through many years.</p>

<p>That the Jameses have been accused of crimes
which they did not commit, there is scarcely room
for doubt. One of the deeds which has been laid to
their charge was the robbery committed at Corinth,
Alcorn county, Mississippi. This event happened
the same day that the train was robbed at Muncie,
Kansas. The two places are many hundred miles
apart, and of course the Jameses could not have
been at both places at the same time. It is possible,
indeed probable, that the robbery at Corinth, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
stripped the bank at that place of a very large sum
of money, was the handiwork of some of the members
of the desperate band of men, of which the
Jameses were the acknowledged leaders. The same
tactics which had been so successfully employed at
Ste. Genevieve, Russellville, Corydon, Gallatin, and
other points, characterized the raid on the funds of
the bank of Corinth. The spoils obtained were exceedingly
valuable, and although energetic pursuit
was made, the robbers succeeded in making their
escape. Their trail, however, was followed into Missouri,
and several circumstances indicate that the
successful bandits were members of the same organization
with the James Boys and Younger Brothers.
After this there was a season of quiet.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1876 the robbers renewed the
campaign for spoils. The incidents of the past year
had begun to become memories, and the success
which had attended the gang during the past years
had given them confidence in their ability to plunder
at will wherever they might select a field for the
exhibition of their prowess and skill. The trees
had assumed their green habiliments, and the early
spring flowers exhaled their choicest perfumes,
scenting the balmy breezes as they blew over hills
and through valleys. The schemers had planned
another raid. This time they selected an objective
point remote from the scenes of their former deeds.
It was a romantic expedition away into the mountain
regions of Eastern Kentucky and the state of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
West Virginia. The spring-birds sang cheery lays
as the brigands marched on to their destined halting
place.</p>

<p>Huntington, West Virginia, is a beautiful town of
about 3,000 inhabitants, situated on the Ohio river,
in Cabell county, and is on the line of the Chesapeake
&amp; Ohio Railroad. In 1876, the advent of the
steam cars had given an impetus to trade, and the
old town had taken a new growth. The bold bandits
had selected Huntington as the scene of a most sensational
event. The tactics which had served so
well on many other occasions were once more
adopted. On a bright April day, four men made
their appearance at the bank. They had come
through the streets without exciting any suspicion.
When they had arrived at the front of the bank,
two of them dismounted, drew their pistols, rushed
into the bank, where they found Mr. Oney, the cashier,
and another gentleman. These they at once
covered with their pistols, and proceeded to overpower
the cashier. They then emptied the contents
of the safe into a sack, and leaving Oney and his
friend securely bound, they proceeded to remount
their horses.</p>

<p>While the two robbers were engaged inside, the
other two, who had remained in the street, very effectually
overawed the citizens who came that way,
by displaying their pistols and occasionally firing a
shot. The whole operation was completed within
less than half an hour from the time the robbers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
made their appearance in Huntington. There were
not many persons who knew what had happened
until after the marauders had left the place. When
the people awakened to a realization of the true nature
of the morning occurrence, there was at once a
storm of excitement raised. Officers of the law and
citizens of Huntington, without official relations,
vied with each other in the alacrity with which they
prepared to pursue the robbers.</p>

<p>As soon as the two robbers who had taken the
treasure were mounted, the whole party galloped
away, intimidating the citizens as they went by firing
off their pistols.</p>

<p>A vigorous pursuit was at once commenced. The
robbers were a long way from their base; and the
road before them was rugged and difficult. For
days the pursuit was unabated. Bligh, the well-known
detective of Louisville, sent his best men on
the road to track the fugitives. The chase became
exciting. Diverted from their intended line of retreat,
the marauders sought refuge among the mountains
of Eastern Kentucky and Tennessee. The
horses of the robbers failed and were abandoned.
Finally the pursuers came up with the fugitives. A
fight ensued, and one of the robbers was killed before
they had left the borders of Kentucky. This
person was identified afterward as Thomason McDaniels,
a brother of Bill, who was killed while attempting
to escape from the officers in Kansas City,
after the affair at Muncie. The pursuit was continued.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
In the hills of Fentress county, Tennessee,
the officers came up with the robbers again. This
time they succeeded in capturing Jack Kean, another
desperado, known in Western Missouri and
Kentucky. The others escaped, and finally made
their way into Missouri.</p>

<p>Kean was taken back and lodged in jail at Cabell.
The grand jury of Cabell county returned a true
bill against him, and in due time he was placed on
trial, convicted, and received a long sentence in the
penitentiary of West Virginia. The presence of
McDaniels and Kean, both well-known desperadoes
of Missouri, at once suggested the James Boys as
leaders in the Huntington robbery. Detective
Bligh at first heralded to the world that Jesse
James was captured when Kean was taken. Statements
subsequently made by the convicted robber
left no doubt that certainly Jesse James, and probably
Frank, were parties to the robbery of the bank
at Huntington.</p>

<p>It matters not who were the robbers in name.
The deed was undoubtedly committed by members
of the organization of which the James Boys were
the most noted leaders. The destiny which seems
to have led them continued to favor them. The
leaders of the Huntington raid escaped, and carried
the bulk of the Huntington bank's funds with them.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Jesse James, the bold raider and dashing outlaw,
in love? Preposterous! And yet why not? Those
who have studied the ways of human nature with
most attention, find nothing singular in the fact that
Jesse might prove an ardent lover, or wonderful in
the assumption that he might be beloved in turn.
Love is the grand passion after all, and few persons
have lived who did not at some time in the course of
their lives feel the deep chords of their hearts touched,
and realize the tender spell that enchained them.
Why should not Jesse James, the man of splendid
physique, the very embodiment of strong passions,
yield to the powerful influence which so universally
sways the human heart? Rather, we might ask,
why should Jesse James not "fall in love," as the
expression goes? It was perfectly natural that he
should at some time, somewhere, find some one endowed
with the capability of awakening in him the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
tender passion. Was he not human? Were his
emotions and constitution so different from the rest
of the children of time? What if he was outlawed?
Had he not eyes to see and ears to hear? Had all
tender feelings found a grave in his heart?</p>

<p>It is true that the nature of his employment and
the circumstances which surrounded him, rendered
his life an isolated one to a certain extent. He was
not thrown into the great whirlpool which the world
calls society, and this very isolation of his position
would very naturally prompt him to seek the companionship
of one who could hold a nearer and dearer
place in his heart than even his brother. He might
yet retrieve some of the disasters of the past, and
wipe out some of the stains which blurred his character,
if led by the sweet, gentle influence of a true
woman. Who can ever know what hopes animated
him; what bright dreams of a better life cheered
him, when he thought of her who would not&mdash;perhaps
could not join in the general execration of his
name? It may be that at such times a vision rose
before him, of a quiet home with peace after the
strife, where love dwelt, and where the bitter curses
of the past might never come; it may be that he
looked forward to the rest which would come to his
tempest-riven breast, when the storm had passed and
the serene sun lighted his pathway through a quiet
land. And at such times it was but natural that he
should seek the presence of the beloved one, and
plead with her&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i6">                  "Oh linger yet a moment!</div>
<div class="line">Is it a sin that I have loved thee so,</div>
<div class="line">And worshiped thy bright image? If it be,</div>
<div class="line">Let grief and suffering atone for that,</div>
<div class="line">Long as this heart can know the power of pain,&mdash;</div>
<div class="line">But let me look on thee and hear thee still."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And what woman ever listened unmoved to such
appeals? "The brave deserve the fair," and the
history of the race shows that when the heart is enlisted,
when the tender bloom of love sheds its perfume
around her, woman is careless of the world's
opinion, and brave in daring its frowns.</p>

<p>Jesse had a fair cousin&mdash;a handsome young lady,
possessed of an amiable disposition, and a mind
well stored with knowledge. This destined bride of
the distinguished outlaw is the daughter of a sister
of the Rev. Robert James, who was married in the
days of her youth to a Mr. Mimms. Miss Zee
Mimms was deprived of a mother's love and guidance
at a time when she was just entering the estate
of womanhood. She had a sister older than herself
who was united in marriage with Mr. Charles McBride,
a respectable carpenter and builder in Kansas
City, about the year 1869. For several years Miss
Mimms resided with her relatives in Kansas City, and
gained the respect and esteem of a large circle of
acquaintances. In the days of her childhood she
had known her cousin Jesse, and his bright blue
eyes and soft, peach-like complexion, and the smile
that used to ripple over his countenance, and his
cheery words, may even then have drawn the little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
girl toward her cousin. As time went by, Zee had
grown to the condition of womanhood, and Jesse had
become celebrated as a daring soldier, and afterwards
a reckless outlaw. But somehow Miss Zee could
never believe her cousin Jesse to be so bad as he was
represented, and when they met&mdash;which they frequently
did&mdash;she always had a word of gentle affection
for cousin Jesse, who was ever kind in his
behavior toward her.</p>

<p>Many times Jesse James was seen in Kansas City,
when to be there was an exposure to imminent
peril. When the wild winds swept across the frozen
river, and screamed over the hills, Jesse was accustomed
to dare the fury of the tempest, brave the chill
of the temperature, and seek the cosy fireside which
became a shrine, when blessed by the presence of
his fair cousin.</p>

<p>And when it was summer time and the forest pathways
were gloomy in the shadows of night; and the
stars in the deep azure vault of heaven alone lent
their feeble rays to illuminate the dark world, then
the outlaw would take his lonely way across the
wide prairies, through the deep-tangled forests where
the owls hide by day and hoot by night, and the
wild tenants of the woodlands make their lair; by
lonely streams, murmuring as their waters go on the
way to mingle with the far-wandering tide of the
mighty Missouri, to seek the side of her whose smile
was always brighter at his coming.</p>

<p>What mattered it to him if the streets of the city
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
were deserted by all, save the guardians of the law,
who, in the deep shadowed recesses waited and
watched for him? His courage owned no limitations
under ordinary circumstances. What might it become
if stimulated by the all-intoxicating influence
of love? If the watchers saw him under the gaslight
in the streets of the slumbering city, they let
him go, and so Jesse's courting days passed away.</p>

<p>The outlaw's wooing proceeded, and was completed.
Who knows what thoughts were his in those
days? Who can ever tell by what processes of reasoning,
or influence of love, Miss Zee Mimms reciprocated
the outlaw's passion? Who knows what
earnest councils she held with her own mind and the
processes which ended in the triumph of the affections,
and a perfect yielding to him, and the development
of a devotion which smiled at contumely
and consented to sacrifice all things which had before
been pleasing to her, at the shrine of love? His
presence became necessary to her happiness, and
her smile was sunlight poured into the otherwise
dark recesses of the outlaw's heart.</p>

<p>So it came about one pleasant evening in 1874,
that Jesse James and Miss Zee Mimms repaired to
the house of Dr. Denham, a mutual friend,
near Kearney, Clay county, Missouri, where
they were met by the Rev. William James, of the M.
E. Church, South, an uncle of Jesse, who proceeded
to unite the lovers in the holy bonds of matrimony.
The ceremony was performed in the presence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
of the Doctor's family and one or two intimate
friends. Jesse James had won a wife, and Miss Zee
Mimms had consented in her devotion to become an
outlaw's bride.</p>

<p>Ostracised by society, proscribed by the law, and
hunted by enemies and the officers of justice, Jesse
James took his bride, and they journeyed away.
Across plains, through valleys, over streams toward
"the clime of the sun," the outlaw and his bride
sought a place where they could rest, and in each
other's society,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Like some vision olden</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>What cared they for the cold world's scorn? Jesse
had provided a cosy home far away on the borders
of civilization, where the names of mountains, vales,
and springs, and streams, are softened in the musical
language of old Castile. But we have heard that even
in that distant land the life of the outlaw's wife is not
isolated, but, on the contrary, under a name which
their conduct has made respectable, they have
friends, and she her associates, who are ignorant of
the history of the outlaw, and hold her in esteem.</p>

<p>A little child, born sometime in 1876, has come to

outlaw has been seen with the innocent little one

ranche. It may be that there are episodes in the life
of Jesse James which are like the green oasis in the
sun-beaten desert&mdash;bright moments when the demon
is temporarily vanquished, and the spirit of goodness
illuminates the world about him. The man who can
love cannot be wholly the slave of vengeance and
hate, and even Jesse James may possess traits of
mind and qualities of the heart, which point to
something higher and better than what is known of
him.</p>

<p>Frank James was an outlaw. The smooth-faced,
beardless youth who came from the school where he
had pondered over the thoughts of Euripides, who
had all Greece for a monument, to unite his fortune
and venture his fate with Quantrell's band, had become
a man, bearded and strong, daring and dangerous
to his fellow-men. And the sprightly intellect
that had enabled him to lead his class, and the
youthful ardor which had conjured up classic forms
among "the sacred relics of Almighty Rome," as
his mental vision was turned back through the vista
of many departed centuries, were now floundering
in the muddy pools, and reveling in plots and
schemes, sordid and debasing. He was not old in
years, and yet he was ripe in experience. Year
after year had chased each other down the steeps of
time since Frank James became a soldier of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
highways, a participant in the well-planned ambushment,
and an executioner in the sudden surprise and
fatal catastrophe to the enemy who came into the
well-planned ambuscade, and he had witnessed unmoved
the agony of victims when shaken by the
throes of death.</p>

<p>Could this man, whose hands were red with the
crimson stains left there by the blood of victims;
whose mind was made harsh and hard by years of
struggle against organized society; whose conscience
must have become seared by the long contact with
the rude, rough elements in human nature; whose
heart must have become callous by reason of the
cruel scenes through which he had passed&mdash;could
such a one have tender dreams of love? And yet
we might ask, why not? The tender affinities of
affection which sprang from psychological causes is
one of the most beneficent schemes of God's benevolence,
which traverses all space in its flights, and
lives the visible token of man's divinity on earth
and his hope in heaven. The hand that would
thwart them would interrupt the course of laws based
on eternal verities.</p>

<p>The fact is, neither time, space, conditions, nor
the recognized canons of social life, can induce or
hinder the inception, growth, or maturity of a passion,
which is acknowledged to be the most potent
of all to which man is subject. Why, then, should
Frank James not be smitten? In his wanderings he
had met many fair ones. And beauty had smiled on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
him. But he knew that they were unacquainted
with his name and antecedents, and so he refused to
be led captive by these, whose love might turn to
hate when they knew all.</p>

<p>It is said by those who know Frank James, that
he is endowed with a very superior mind; that his
education is very good; that he is able to read the
classics, and can converse fluently in both the German
and Spanish languages. With these accomplishments,
he possesses a handsome person and agreeable
features. In conversation, he speaks in a soft,
low tone of voice, and in private life, among his
friends, his manners are pleasing, and well calculated
to produce a favorable impression. Frank has been
about the world a great deal, and has mingled in refined
society not a little. It is his custom to visit
New York almost every season, and sometimes he
goes to Saratoga, Newport and Long Branch.
Friends of Frank assume that he is in many respects
a superior man to Jesse; that he has more principle,
and that there is far less of the desperado in
his composition. He is cool, cautious, shrewd, and
more manly than the other, and is not so reckless
nor so revengeful in disposition.</p>

<p>Frank James was susceptible to the blandishments
of the fair sex in the days of his youth. In Kentucky,
he came near being caught in the silken
meshes spread by a beautiful young lady of the
"Blue Grass" country, who had come to regard
him as a hero, whose adventurous career she longed
to share.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
But fate interposed for her sake, or against him.
Frank found it for his interest to take his departure
from Kentucky, and it was not convenient for him
to return for two whole years. In the interim, another
gallant was attracted to her side, and eventually
won her affections, and the young lady was married.</p>

<p>A story is told, by persons who claim to know
much of Frank James' private affairs, about a love
affair between that redoubtable outlaw and an heiress
in New York. She was beautiful and accomplished,
and when she met the handsome and gentlemanly
outlaw, who was not known in that character
to her, she conceived an admiration for him
which was fast ripening into affection. They rode
together through the parks, and were soothed by
the music of the waves, when the twilight and shadows
fell, as together they strolled along the lonely
shore. But circumstances over which she had no
control summoned her away from the side of the
Western adventurer, and they never met again.</p>

<p>So the years passed away, and Frank James found
one being long ago who inspired his heart with tenderer
dreams of love than any which had ever come
to him before. For years the fair face, with its
shadings of glossy brown hair, and eyes of deepest
azure, glancing from beneath their long silken lashes,
was imprinted on his mind and shrined in his heart.
Frank James had met her many times, and no more
touching story of woman's devotion has yet been
told; than that of the attachment of pretty Annie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
Ralston for Frank James, the bold border bandit.
In time to come, the writers of the romance of the
period covered by the career of the James Boys,
will recall the name of the fair girl who became the
outlaw's bride, and weave around it the choicest
flowers of literature.</p>

<p>There are many people about the old town of
Independence who cherish pleasant memories of fair
Annie Ralston. There are many who knew and
loved her long ago, who will not soon forget the
beautiful face of the outlaw's bride. And long after
those who knew her in the halcyon days of her innocent
girlhood shall have passed to the quiet repose
beneath the sod in "the silent cities of the dead,"
her story will be repeated. Many a romance has
been based on incidents in lives far less dramatic
than has fallen to the fortune or the fate of Annie
Ralston. The years which have rolled their cycles
round to swell the measure of the greedy past, have
not been so many that they have swallowed up the
memories which cluster around the name of the gentle
Annie, and bring sighs to the lips of those who
but a few short winters ago conned with her the lessons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
of the sages from the dreary pages of text
books when they were schoolmates.</p>

<p>People are not all ossified&mdash;brain, sense and heart,
because God's Commentary on his written Revelation
was given first&mdash;was handed down from a
thousand Sinais, and strewed in green, and golden
shadowy lines through all the ages. It yet lives,
and is, from under His own hand, above, around,
beneath us; and by it we may understand that holy
mystery&mdash;how God is Love, and Love is God-like.
And we feel, and know, that never again to us from
out the shade of the years, can ministers of grace or
glad ideals come, except through such sweet enchantment.
Who, then, will condemn gentle Annie
Ralston, the pet of the class, the warm friend, the
glad-hearted girl, if she proved at last to be&mdash;like all
her sisters&mdash;human? What circumstances conspired
to induce her to become an outlaw's bride? If we
could answer all the questions which might be asked
concerning the emotions of the heart, the freaks of
the mind, and other phenomena of human nature,
and the structure of society, then might we be able
to answer why fair Annie Ralston became the wife
of Frank James, the proscribed enemy of society.
But we cannot engage in such an undertaking. Her
story is brief, but full of interest.</p>

<p>Before the period of blighting war, which swept
like a destructive tornado over the fairest portions of
Western Missouri, Annie's father, Mr. Ralston, was
a wealthy man, and his home was one of the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
pleasant to be found in the vicinity of Independence.
He was a gentleman of culture and refinement, and
his wealth gave him leisure to cultivate all the social
graces. His hospitality was unbounded, and no man
was more esteemed than Samuel Ralston.</p>

<p>Annie was a "wee girl" when the thunder peal of
war burst in all its lurid terrors all around and about
her. It was no period of sentimental dreaming, and
she was early accustomed to see and hear of bloodshed
and devastation. She must necessarily have
grown familiar with scenes which, under ordinary
circumstances, would have excited her terror, and
she had learned to look unmoved on the bloody
corpse of the battle's victim. But no storm can continue
forever; after the convulsion comes quiet; after
the night dawns the day&mdash;so, at last, the war-cloud
rolled away. Then commenced the work of collecting
fragments of wrecked fortunes and rebuilding
waste places. But some wrecks were complete, and
no fragments remained. In a large measure this
was the case with the life-barque in which Mr. Ralston
sailed down the river of time.</p>

<p>Annie grew with the passing years, and stood, as
it were, "with reluctant feet on the boundary where
childhood and womanhood meet." The residence
of Mr. Ralston was convenient to the Independence
Female College, and Annie became a student in that
institution. She possessed excellent intellectual
gifts, and in her course of study she led her classes.
In due time the prescribed course of mental training
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
was completed, and "at commencement," fair Annie
carried away the highest honors of her class. She
was now a young lady, accomplished in "all the
learning of the school." She sang delightfully, and
could touch and cause to thrill with deepest harmony,
the chords of the harp and other instruments.
She was a favorite in society at once.</p>

<p>And Annie Ralston was handsome&mdash;almost beautiful.
Her complexion was fair and soft, her features
regular and pleasing, her eyes were large and azure
blue, and these soulful orbs looked out from curtains
of long silken lashes of deep brown, that lent a
charm to their expression, and her long brown
tresses well completed this charming picture. And
she possessed a symmetry of form and a gracefulness
of carriage which might well attract the admiration
of those who knew her.</p>

<p>But there came a time when a shadow fell athwart
her pathway, and eclipsed this star in the social
firmament. Annie's father had been ardent in his
attachment to the Southern cause, and all who had
contended in behalf of that cause were ever
welcome to the hospitality of his home. He had
suffered much from the consequences of the war,
and perhaps more from the genial convivialities
in which he indulged, and which had extended beyond
the bounds of propriety. Frank and Jesse
James, with their confederates, became frequent
visitors at the Ralston home. People saw them
there often, and it was whispered softly at first, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
shouted aloud later, that pretty Annie Ralston was
an attraction for the outlaws, and received from
them, without rebuke, their openly-expressed admiration,
and then her social star paled, and finally went
out. Frank James became to her a hero worthy of
her love&mdash;nay, her heart's deep adoration. She
waited with impatience his coming, and when he was
away, and she thought of the hazards which he
might make, and the destruction which might overtake
him, she grew faint through apprehension. To
her, he was assiduous and gentle and kind, whatever
might be his disposition toward others, and she gave
her heart to him long before an opportunity was presented
to her to yield to him her hand.</p>

<p>One bright day, in 1875, some friends who had
known pretty Annie Ralston from the days of her
childhood, met her at the Union Depot, Kansas
City, with many valises and travelling bags in
charge. "Would she go up in town? Could they
render her any service?" were questions which were
asked. No, at another time she would go up town,
there was nothing they could do for her. Soon she
was joined by her outlawed lover. Together they
took a train and proceeded to Leavenworth, Kansas,
where the vows which they had made to each other
were renewed and sealed by legal authority, and
fair Annie Ralston became the outlaw's bride, and
with him she journeyed toward the yellow Southern
sea, where the sunlight is warm and the breezes
balmy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
It was a sacrifice to thus banish herself from that
society in which she was so well fitted to shine as
one of its brightest ornaments; it was a trial to surrender
up the friends and associates of her girlhood;
to bid adieu to those who were near and dear to
her; it was heroic to cast herself upon the care of
the man she loved. On the altar of her affection,
therefore, she placed all the idols of her youth; and
in her devotion she proceeded to dig a wide, deep
grave in which to bury forever the images which she
had cherished. And so Annie Ralston became an
outlaw's wife.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />
<span class="small">A SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR HAUL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It had been some weeks since the people of the
West had enjoyed a sensation growing out of the
robbery of a train, or the plundering of a bank.
Frank and Jesse James, and Cole, and Jim, and Bob
Younger, with their merry companions, had been unusually
quiet for quite a long season for these restless
rovers and adroit plunderers. The gang was increasing
in numbers, and was now really formidable.
Others as daring had joined themselves to the noted
outlaws&mdash;the Jameses and the Youngers. Cal Carter
from Texas, and Clell Miller, and Bill Chadwell,
Charles Pitts, and Sam Bass, and Bill Longley, and
the Hardins and the Moores of the Indian Territory
and Texas divisions of the clan were frequently with
Frank and Jesse James and the Younger Brothers.
In the gang, but apparently merely as a subaltern,
whose principal employment was to hold the horses
of the chief robbers when business required them to
dismount, was a young fellow who went by the name
of Hobbs Kerry.</p>

<p>Before Otterville, the protestations and denials of
the Jameses and the Youngers were accepted by
many good citizens, and there were numbers of very
honorable persons who believed sincerely that these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
men were sadly slandered. The express robbery at
Rocky Cut, near Otterville, served to remove the
scales from the eyes of numbers of these good people,
and Frank and Jesse James, and the three
Youngers were revealed before the public as most
dangerous highwaymen.</p>

<p>The principals in the Otterville affair were Frank
James, his brother Jesse, Cole Younger, and his
brother Bob, Clell Miller, Charlie Pitts, Bill Chadwell
and Hobbs Kerry. These men concerted the
project in Southwest Missouri, in the lead mining
districts. Frequent interviews took place between
Frank and Jesse James, and Cole and Bob Younger
in regard to the feasibility of the undertaking. The
Jameses were the original suggestors of the enterprise,
and from what information we have been able
to gather, the Youngers did not at first entertain the
suggestion favorably; indeed, it was some time before
it was finally agreed that the attempt should be
made. Then the bandits discussed the route to be
taken, and the place to be selected for the scene of
this notable robbery, on the iron-highway. All
these were settled in due time, and everything was
ready to carry out their well-matured plan.</p>

<p>Jesse James was the leader, the others merely
acting in concert with him, and taking their places
in accordance with his suggestions.</p>

<p>The expedition left the scene of their plotting
about the first day of July, 1876.</p>

<p>Before leaving, the band separated into two parties,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
Jesse and Frank James, Bill Chadwell and Bob
Younger, composed one, and Cole Younger, Charlie
Pitts, Clell Miller and Hobbs Kerry, made up the
other. The journey through the country was made
leisurely enough. The two parties travelled by different
routes, and had no difficulty in securing lodging
places. Sometimes they travelled in the night
to make the distance to the house of a friend in good
time the next day.</p>

<p>On Sunday, July 3rd, there were four of the bandits
at Duval's house. Tuesday a part of the band
were in California, and after lingering about the place
for a part of the day, they mounted their horses and
rode to a house four miles north of the town, where
four others of the robbers were stopping. A heavy
rain came on that night, and so the robbers stayed
nearly all of the day on the 5th, and remained during
the night. There is no evidence that the people
where they stayed had any knowledge of the character
of the persons whom they received under their
roof. However, Jesse James and Cole Younger
were acquainted with the gentleman, but not under
their names.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 6th, the raiders mounted
their horses and rode west in pairs. The James Boys
travelled together, Clell Miller and Hobbs Kerry rode
by each other, Charlie Pitts and Coleman Younger
formed a pair, and Bill Chadwell and Bob Younger
followed another route in company. These all
travelled different roads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
The place of meeting previously agreed upon was
a spot about two miles east from the bridge, across
the Lamine river, and the time appointed was at 3
o'clock Friday evening, July 8th. There were designated
stopping places on all the roads. The
Jameses under assumed names were acquainted personally
with a number of very respectable people
along the route travelled by them, and therefore had
no difficulty in obtaining comfortable quarters and
receiving a hospitable welcome. And so of the
others of that band&mdash;"on mischief bent"&mdash;they all
had good quarters on Thursday night, and as only
two travelled together on a road, no suspicion was
aroused on account of their presence.</p>

<p>The robbers came by pairs to the rendezvous.
They had all assembled by 4 o'clock in the evening.
Some of them went without their dinners that day.
Here the whole band remained until sundown on the
evening of the 8th.</p>

<p>The place selected was at a deep cut known as
Rocky Cut, about four miles east of Otterville, in
Pettis county, Missouri, on the line of the Missouri
Pacific railroad. Three of the band, Bob Younger,
Clell Miller and Charlie Pitts, were detailed to capture
the watchman at the bridge. Bill Chadwell and
Hobbs Kerry, it appears, were assigned the duty of
taking care of the horses. A dense piece of timber
land adjacent to a field was selected as the place of
concealment. The express train bound east was due
at that spot about 11 o'clock at night. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
robbers did not arrive at the designated rendezvous
until some time after the curtains of night had been
drawn over the scene. At a little after 9 o'clock,
Younger, Miller and Pitts went down to the bridge,
and were hailed by the watchman. They were close
upon him, and with drawn revolvers and fearful oaths
they commanded him to surrender. The helpless
watchman could not do otherwise. They took him
in charge and secured his signal lanterns.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me?" asked the
astonished watchman.</p>

<p>"You keep still," was the reply.</p>

<p>"But you ain't going to hurt me?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"What do we want to hurt you for? We want
that money on the train, that's all we care for," was
the reply he received.</p>

<p>The whole party walked up the track to the mouth
of the cut. It was about half past ten o'clock. A
heap of rocks and a number of old cross ties were
piled across the rails. Then the cunning brigands
sat down quietly in the darkness to await the coming
of the train. The horses of the robbers were about
fifty yards away ready to be bestridden, and fresh
enough to make a long journey if that should be
necessary. Crouched there, they were silent as the
broken fragments of rocks which lay scattered around
them. They had not long to wait. A distant
rumbling was heard, like the first low mutterings of
thunder before the storm cloud appears. Then it
grew louder and shriller like the raging wind. It was
the train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
The robbers were not asleep. Charlie Pitts had
been detailed to display the red lantern&mdash;the danger
signal&mdash;as the train came thundering around the
curve into the cut. He performed his part of the
programme well. Precisely at the right spot the
train came to a standstill. The engineer had reversed
his engine and put on the air brakes.</p>

<p>Instantly the train was boarded by a number of
masked men, said to have been twelve at least, all
heavily armed. Guards were placed at each end of
the cars, and the leader boarded the express car,
compelled the messenger under threats of immediate
death to open his safe, and then the contents were
emptied out into a sack, and the car was thoroughly
searched for valuable packages. The result was
about $17,000 were secured and carried away for the
use and behoof of the robbers.</p>

<p>The whole transaction was completed in less than
an hour. The passengers were greatly alarmed during
the time of the detention. The robbers stationed
at the ends of the cars kept their revolvers bearing
upon the passengers, and would not allow them to
stir a finger under threats of death. Every moment
they expected their turn to be robbed would come.
But the robbers appeared to be satisfied with the
amount realized from the plundering of the express
car, and when they had accomplished that job thoroughly,
they released the train, sought their horses
and rode away. Several shots were fired during the
time the train was standing, for the purpose of keeping
the passengers in a state of alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
The news was telegraphed from the next station to
St. Louis, Sedalia, Kansas City and other points.
By this event the whole country was thoroughly
excited. The detective forces of St. Louis, Kansas
City, Chicago, and even the cities of the Atlantic
seaboard were taken by surprise, and aroused to
make efforts to capture them. The railroad and
express companies offered large rewards, and the
Governor of the state took measures to aid in the
pursuit of the brigands.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the men who had created all this furore
of excitement rode through the darkness with
their treasure bag. When "the first faint blush of
dawn streaked the east," the plunderers of the express
car at Rocky Cut were twenty miles away and
just turning off the main highway into the dim recesses
of a large forest.</p>

<p>After travelling more than a mile in the woods, the
brigands came to an open space. Here they dismounted.
Jesse James had the treasure bag. During
the journey, Frank James, Cole Younger and
Charlie Pitts had relieved each other alternately in
carrying the precious burden. Now they had reached
a safe place, and the spoils of the adventure were
about to be divided. Frank James acted as master
of ceremonies on that occasion. Whether "the
divide" was an equal one we are not advised, and
perhaps we shall never know. The envelopes were
torn from the express packages and the money divided
into separate heaps, one of which was given to
each of the men who had participated in the exploit</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
The ceremony of dividing the money having been
gone through with, and Jesse James, Cole Younger,
Frank James and Charlie Pitts having parceled out
the captured jewelry among themselves, the robbers
remounted and separated into pairs, each pair selecting
the route which pleased them best. In the day
time they rode in the woods and along by-paths; in
the night they returned to the highways, and were
soon secure from pursuit because they went at once
among friends who, if they were acquainted with the
character of their guests, "never gave away anything."</p>

<p>An outrage of so daring a character was not slow
in producing effects. The news had been flashed
afar on the lightning's track. The Chief of Police of
St. Louis, the marshals and constables, and county
sheriffs were aroused to unusual activity. The people
everywhere were excited by an event of so sensational
a character. A keen pursuit was inaugurated.
Watchful eyes and open ears were in every
town and hamlet throughout Missouri, and even in
adjacent states. This time, it appeared, the robbers
would be surely compelled to remain hidden far
from the habitations of man.</p>

<p>But secure in their retreats, the shrewd leaders of
the raid, Jesse and Frank James, and Cole and Bob
Younger and Charlie Pitts, laughed at the efforts of
the officers of the law to capture them. They enjoyed
reading the newspapers containing accounts
of their daring feat, and made merry at what they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
were pleased to term "the stupid work of the d&mdash;d
detectives."</p>

<p>The robbers had one single thing on their minds
which gave them some concern. The "cub" robber,
Hobbs Kerry, was scarcely shrewd enough to
evade capture, and, they feared, not brave enough
to withstand the pressure which they knew would
be brought to bear upon him to "make him squeal
on his associates." What if Kerry should fall into
the hands of the hunters? And was it not extremely
probable that he would? These were questions
which they asked themselves, and in time they
framed an answer in the form of another question,
"What if he does? We don't know the fellow?"</p>

<p>We have said the passengers and trainmen were
passive witnesses of the proceedings of the robbers.
But there was one person on the train who was not
afraid to resist. That individual was the train newsboy.
Johnny, as he was called, had a small
pistol, of a cheap grade, with which to defend himself
against all enemies, and robbers in particular.
Now the opportunity had come to display the latent
heroism which he knew he possessed. Johnny did
not believe in being plundered, and, though his
weapon was not very dangerous, he believed he
could do some execution with it; at any rate, he
could try. From the car window, where he had
taken a position, he opened fire on the marauders. His
first shot was ineffective, and the bandits derisively
encouraged him to try again, when they discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
the youthful appearance and diminutive size of their
assailant. Johnny took them at their word, and
blazed away again. The robbers were well satisfied
and good humored, and they laughed and jeered at
the little hero who had exhibited so much courage.
They told him he would do for a train-robber himself
when he was a little older. Johnny insisted for
a time that he knew he had shot one of the robbers
badly.</p>

<p>Charlie Pitts, Bill Chadwell and Hobbs Kerry
made a forced march to Southwest Missouri. Late
Saturday night they forded Grand river. After going
a little distance from the river, the three robbers
dismounted, threw themselves on the ground, and
slept soundly until morning. Here Kerry's horse,
which was well broken down, was abandoned. The
saddle he hid in the brush in the Grand river bottom.
Kerry at this point separated from Pitts and
Chadwell, they remaining in the Grand river forests,
while he proceeded to Montrose station, on the M.,
K. &amp; T. railway. He had not long been there when
a train bound south came along. He stepped on
the car and went down to Fort Scott, Kansas. Finding
a clothing store open, he purchased a good suit
of clothes, which he donned at once. With valise
in hand, he boldly entered a hotel, called for supper,
which he partook of, and then proceeded on the
train to Parsons, took lodgings there, where he remained
until 4 o'clock next morning. From Vinita,
to which he went from Parsons, he proceeded to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
Granby, where he had "a good time with the boys."
From Granby to Joplin, and from that place to
Granby again, and then away down in the Indian
Territory Hobbs Kerry went, without remaining
very long at one place. Wherever he went he
drank, and whenever he drank whisky he talked,
and showed his money and boasted. He was liberal
with the boys, had money for the faro dealer,
and was for the time "a hale fellow well met" with
all. But the eyes that were looking, and the ears
that were listening, putting this and that together
by an act of cogitation, concluded that Hobbs Kerry
knew about the Rocky Cut business.</p>

<p>It was not a mistake. The detectives "pulled"
Kerry, and when he had time to reflect, he unfolded
his mind, and told of his friends and their ride at
night. He proved to be "a good peacher," as the
police say, and whatever may be the slight inconsistencies
of his narrative of the Otterville affair, the
events at Northfield, Minnesota, a few months later,
confirm the truthfulness of Hobbs Kerry's story in
all the main particulars.</p>

<p>Of course the James Boys and their friends were
swift to denounce Hobbs Kerry as a fraud, and his
stories of the midnight ride and the flaring of the
"danger signal" before the train, as pure fabrications
of a diseased or wicked brain.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Jameses and Youngers had not
gone far away. The former found friends and a safe
retreat in the eastern part of Jackson county, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
the latter retired to St. Clair county, where they
rested in contentment for a season. The Jameses
have friends yet in a certain neighborhood in that
section of Jackson county&mdash;men and women&mdash;who,
despite their known character, and the edict of outlawry
against them, would receive them into their
houses and treat them not only with ordinary hospitality,
but with marked consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br />
<span class="small">IN MINNESOTA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Hitherto the brigands, led by the Jameses and
the Youngers, had only committed outrages in those
countries with the physical features of which they
were well acquainted. They had ridden through
Missouri, Arkansas, Texas and Kentucky, and Iowa
was not so far away from their haunts in Clay
county that they could not reasonably hope to retreat
to their hiding places. The list of outrages
already committed by them was extravagantly long.
Commencing at Russellville, Kentucky, they had
ransacked bank safes at Gallatin, Corydon, Iowa,
Columbia, Kentucky, Ste. Genevieve, Mo., Huntington,
West Virginia, and a section of the band had
paid a visit to, and plundered the bank at Corinth,
Mississippi. They had stopped trains in Kansas,
Wyoming, Iowa and Missouri, and they had plundered
stages in Arkansas, Texas and Kansas. But
over the whole territory intervening between the
widely separated scenes of their depredations, they
had often travelled and were perfectly familiar with
the topography of the country, and had friends in
many places.</p>

<p>Having achieved such remarkable success in their
nefarious calling, the brigand chiefs were emboldened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
to enter upon new enterprises, and seek new fields
for the exercise of their prowess and genius. They
agreed to go beyond the borders of their accustomed
field of operations.</p>

<p>After Otterville, a part of the gang went into St.
Clair county, and the other members of the banditti
proceeded to Clay county, to the vicinity of Kearney,
where resided the mother of Frank and Jesse
James, Mrs. Zerelda Samuels. That person was
always true to the interests of her sons, and under
no circumstances did she ever desert their cause or
betray their designs. Mrs. Samuels was a very useful
ally of Frank and Jesse, and when hard pressed
in other quarters, they were always sure of a safe retreat
and succor in the vicinity of the Samuels
house.</p>

<p>The successful robbery accomplished at Otterville,
had created a profound sensation throughout the
southwest, and the law abiding citizens were vigilant
and suspicious, and it was not a pleasant time to
travel in any direction where the least possible suspicion
in regard to the character of the traveller was
once aroused. Therefore, the robbers of the train
at Otterville sought their hiding places and remained
quiet for a time.</p>

<p>But idleness under such circumstances became extremely
irksome to the free riders, accustomed as
they were to a life of activity and exciting adventure.
The division of the band from St. Clair
county, journeyed into Clay county, Missouri, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
then began a series of conferences in regard to the
next campaign which they contemplated inaugurating.</p>

<p>These consultations between the leaders of the
banditti were held in a thick forest near the residence
of Mrs. Samuels. The result of the deliberations
was the development of a plan to pay a visit to
Minnesota, and raid some bank there, the exact
place of its situation to be determined when they
should have arrived in that state.</p>

<p>Who originated the scheme is a question which, in
all human probability, will forever remain unanswered.
The credit of the project has been often
given to Jesse James. Whether or not he originated
it, we have good reason to know that he was one of
the parties who went to Northfield, and in all probability
he was the leader of the band.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, a plan was concocted to pay a
visit to Minnesota, and plunder as many of the banks
in that state as possible before the beginning of winter,
and then retire to winter quarters on the Texas
and Mexican frontiers. The general plans were
finally agreed upon, and about the middle of August,
1876, the bandit camp in the vicinity of the
Samuels house was broken up, and the brigands,
separating in couples, commenced their long ride
through the country to the flourishing villages of
Minnesota.</p>

<p>The party which left Clay county was composed
of Frank and Jesse James; Coleman, Robert and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
James Younger; Clell Miller, Bill Chadwell and
Charlie Pitts. It is related, on what appears excellent
authority, that Cole Younger and Bill Chadwell
preceded the other members of the gang, to fix upon
a suitable rendezvous. Near Mankato, Bill Chadwell
had "a friend," a man who had often before
rendered him substantial service. Preconcerted
"signs" of the route to be taken by the main body
of the bandits had been left by the advance guard,
Cole Younger and Bill Chadwell. The final rendezvous
selected by these leaders was at Mankato,
and the whole band then proceeded to Chadwell's
friend's resting place, where their final councils were
held.</p>

<p>A gentleman of the highest respectability, well
known in Central Missouri, who is in a position to
be informed, assures us that Cole Younger did not
favor an attack on the bank at Northfield; indeed,
that he was opposed to raiding any bank in Minnesota,
but that he was overruled in his judgment by
the other members of the gang. It is said that Cole
favored a movement into Canada, where the prospects
for a large haul were believed to be very much
better. But whatever might have been his wishes,
the other members of the band did not accede to
them, and, after due consideration, it was determined
to strike a Minnesota bank. Cole Younger
was too far committed to recede, and so he submitted
to the will of the majority, and was among
the law's victims after Northfield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
Bill Chadwell was for many years a border rough
and horse-thief in Minnesota. He had committed
depredations in many parts of that state, and was
perfectly familiar with the geography and topography
of the country. With a vast number of the dishonest
and rough class in that state, he was on terms
of intimate personal acquaintance. To him, as a
guide, the other members of the brigand company
looked with confidence to lead them successfully
to a handsome deposit of spoils, and away from pursuers
and pursuit. Chadwell's friends were relied
upon to afford them succor in the hour of need, and
Chadwell's skill inspired them with hopes of great
gains, at a small sacrifice of time and little risk of
danger.</p>

<p>All these things had been discussed, and the plans
of the gang were well matured before the departure
from Clay county. It was a long expedition, and
the principal members of the company were unfamiliar
with the country into which they journeyed.
They based their hopes of success on the conditions
which at that time existed in Minnesota. It was at
that season of the year when the grain growers were
disposing of their crops; when it was supposed
grain buyers and shippers would have their heaviest
deposits in bank, and when the farmers were "in
funds," which the robbers doubted not would be
placed in the country banks for safe-keeping.
Moreover, they reasoned that inasmuch as the people
of Minnesota were unacquainted with their bold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
methods, that, as usual, when they made an onset,
the customary panic would ensue, and the risk taken
would be small.</p>

<p>Thus the preliminaries of the celebrated raid into
Northfield were settled. Never before had this gang
of desperadoes failed in accomplishing their object,
and when the last council was held, and it was settled
that Northfield should be the objective point of their
great raid into Minnesota, "the signs" were propitious,
and the superstitious element in the character
of the outlaws rested satisfied.</p>

<p>The remainder of the band divided into couples.
Jesse and Frank James, as usual, travelled the road
in company. Bob Younger and Charlie Pitts went
together, and James Younger and Clell Miller bore
each other company by the way. These separate
detachments travelled different roads, and kept a
good lookout for favorable places for concealment in
case of necessity, and they also noted the characteristics
of the surface of the country over which they
passed.</p>

<p>Previous to leaving Missouri, Jesse James wrote,
or caused to be written, two letters for publication
in the Kansas City <cite>Times</cite>, denying the charge
of complicity in the Otterville robbery, and denouncing
the statement of Hobbs Kerry as "a villainous
pack of lies." These letters were printed,
and lead to the belief that the Jameses were still in
Missouri. The latest one of these letters was dated
"Safe Retreat, August 18th, 1876," and appeared in
the Kansas City <cite>Times</cite> August 23d, 1876.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
Divided as they were, their passage through the
country excited no comment. They travelled as respectable
persons might have travelled. In the
evenings they would put up at a respectable village
inn, or country farm-house, and in the mornings they
paid for their accommodations as any other reputable
citizens might have done. They did not hurry,
because they did not want to break down their
horses. The distance was great, and they were
many days on the road. It was about the 1st of
September, 1876, when the whole band had arrived
in the neighborhood of Mankato. Their advance
agents, having found a suitable place for a rendezvous
at the house of Chadwell's friend, met their
comrades, and, without exciting suspicion among
the people, they directed the various detachments to
the designated place of meeting.</p>

<p>The robbers were now in Minnesota, but as yet
they had not determined which of more than half a
dozen banks they would rob. First, the claims of
some one of the three banks doing business in Mankato
to the distinction were considered. But the
proposition to rob any one of them met with little
consideration in the council of the brigands. They
reasoned that three banks in such a place would
naturally cause the business and investment funds of
the community to be divided into three parts, no one
of which could be very large, and as they "played
for high stakes" at a great risk, they concluded to
let Mankato banks alone. Then they considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
the claims of the bank at St. Peter to be plundered.
But there was not enough business done in the place,
and it was not surrounded by a community deemed
wealthy, and the brigands concluded to pass St.
Peter, believing that they would not get a large haul
in case they should raid the place. Several other
banks were considered, and the probabilities as to the
amount of treasure likely to be obtained were all
considered. Finally, indications pointed to the
bank of Northfield as probably richer in the
treasures contained in its vaults than any other in
that region of Minnesota.</p>

<p>Northfield, the place selected by the desperadoes
as the scene of their attempt at plundering, is a
nourishing town on the line of the Milwaukee and
St. Paul railroad, situated in the northeast corner of
Rice county, Minnesota. The town is compactly
built, and contains a population of about 2,000
souls. The country around Northfield is very productive,
and there is considerable activity in commercial
pursuits in the village. The bank building
is situated in the very center of the business portion
of the town. At the time the raid was made a large
sum of money had accumulated in the vault of the
institution. But Northfield happened to be peopled
by a hardy and courageous race of pioneers who
were not made of the material to submit with a good
grace to be plundered by strange outlaws from
another state.</p>

<p>But the leaders of the brigands had selected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
Northfield, and it only remained to fix upon a time
when the attempt should be made. That time was
set for the afternoon of September 7th, 1876.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br />
<span class="small">THE ATTACK AT NORTHFIELD&mdash;HAYWOOD'S DEATH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Sometime before noon on the 7th of September,
four well mounted and well armed men approached
Northfield from the north. They did not at once
enter the town, but remained on that side of the
bridge in the suburbs for the advance of the other
division of the band, which came via Dundas, a small
station on the line of the railway about four miles
south of Northfield. The brigands from Dundas
were Cole and James Younger, Bill Chadwell and
Clell Miller. On the north side were Frank and
Jesse James, Charlie Pitts and Robert Younger.
About 2 o'clock in the afternoon, Cole Younger and
his party appeared, then the brigands rode into
town and directly to the bank, the exact position of
which had been before ascertained. Jesse and Frank
James and Cole Younger dismounted and entered
the bank. The brigands had entered the town at a
full charge, shouting at the top of their voices and
firing off their pistols as they rode. The inhabitants
were taken by surprise, but were not at all panic-stricken.
The movement on the bank was noted,
and its object at once comprehended.</p>

<p>The three leading brigands who had entered the
bank proceeded to business at once. They sprang
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
over the counter and confronted the surprised cashier,
Mr. J. L. Haywood, with a huge knife, which they
placed at his throat, and ordered him to open the
safe, threatening him with instant death in case he
refused. The knife had already marked his throat,
but the brave cashier refused to comply with their
demands. Again with fearful threats the command
was repeated. But Haywood still persisted in his
refusal, when one of them, now generally believed
to have been Jesse James, placed the muzzle of his
pistol to Haywood's right temple, and fired. The
cashier fell, and expired ere he had touched the
floor. Besides the cashier, there were Mr. A. E.
Bunker, assistant cashier, and Mr. Frank Wilcox,
clerk. These were ordered to hold up their hands
when the robbers first entered. Of course, under
the circumstances, they could not do otherwise than
to obey. After Haywood fell they turned to Mr.
Bunker and ordered him to open the vault. That
gentleman declared that he did not know the combination.
Then they thrust a pistol into his face
and made other threatening demonstrations. Mr.
Bunker, acting under an impulse to preserve his own
life, fled out through the back door. As he ran, the
robbers fired at him, the ball taking effect in his
shoulder. They seem not to have paid any further
attention to Mr. Wilcox, but occupied the remainder
of the brief time allowed them in efforts to find the
cashier's money drawer. The nickel drawer was
found, and they scattered the contents of that over
the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
Meanwhile, an exciting scene was transpiring in
the street in front of the bank building. A Mr.
Wheeler, a young gentleman who occupied a second-story
room in a building opposite, happened to
possess a gun. Seizing this weapon, he took deliberate
aim and fired. The ball took effect, and Charlie
Pitts, a notorious Texas desperado, fell from his
horse, shot through the heart. The shots fired by
the brigands who had remained on the street did not
have the desired effect in intimidating the citizens of
Northfield. In a few moments many citizens who
had seized guns and pistols, and whatever other
weapons came in their way, were rushing toward the
bank. Mr. Wheeler having been so successful in his
first shot, fired a second time, and Bill Chadwell fell,
mortally wounded, from his horse. By this time
others were firing from windows, and one of the
horses was struck and fell dead. Another horse
which had been ridden by Charlie Pitts ran through
the street. Another one of the band was struck by
a bullet, but managed to keep his place.</p>

<p>The situation was desperate. The leaders in the
bank had not succeeded in getting anything, when
the events happening in the street admonished them
that their only salvation was in immediate flight.
They rushed out of the bank, mounted their horses,
and the six living bandits galloped away. Indeed,
there was need that they should. Already a band
of fifty citizens, well mounted and well armed, were
nearly ready to take the road in pursuit. At the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
head of this party rode Wheeler, who had already
proved himself to be cool and daring.</p>

<p>The flight of the discomfited robbers was rapid.
These free riders would never mount an inferior
horse. But chances for escape were very few. The
robbery, or rather, bold attempt at robbery, and especially
the death of Mr. Haywood, a gentleman
held in the very highest esteem by the community at
Northfield, had created a state of feeling in the public
mind which would not allow the people to rest
satisfied until the murderers were either captured or
killed. In less than twenty-four hours the whole region
about was notified of the occurrence at Northfield,
and not less than four hundred well armed and
well mounted men were in hot pursuit of the six surviving
brigands.</p>

<p>The excitement occasioned by the events at
Northfield was at fever heat. Efforts to capture the
outlaws were further stimulated by the proclamation
of Governor Pillsbury offering a reward of $1,000
for the apprehension of each of the robbers, or $6,000
for the capture of the survivors of the band.</p>

<p>The bandits fled in a southwestern direction, toward
the little hamlet of Shieldsville, situated about 20
miles on an air line, southwest from the scene of the
tragedy at Northfield. The route taken by the robbers
made the distance more than twenty-five miles;
yet they were at Shieldsville before dark. They
passed straight through the place and made no concealment
of their identity. Shieldsville is a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
post village, containing a population of no more
than 175 souls. As they passed through the village,
they shouted to the citizens who were on the streets
to get into their houses, and they made such demonstrations
by firing off their pistols that the people
were greatly alarmed. The pursuers meanwhile
were gathering about them. Sheriff Davis and posse
were behind them; Sheriff Estes and posse were
before them, and there were officers and armed citizens
to the right and to the left of them. Their situation
became extremely critical after leaving
Shieldsville.</p>

<p>But the indomitable courage of the bandits seemed
for a time to promise them a final escape.</p>

<p>From Shieldsville the bandits travelled in a westerly
direction toward Kilkenny, a post town and railway
station in Le Sueur county. They were now
avoiding the towns and travelled highways, and
keeping in the forest, and travelling through the
farms. All the crossing places on the streams were
guarded by armed citizens. The guards at the ford
on French creek became alarmed at the approach of
the bandits and fled, so that they met no resistance
at the crossing place. They remained one night for
rest in a large forest near Kilkenny. The next
morning they crossed the ford at Little Canyon.
They pressed on toward the west. The route was
beset with difficulties and dangers for them. They
were anxious to reach the borderland, the frontier
region, where men are few and wild.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
There was no rest for them. It was at length
necessary for them to abandon their horses. They
had camped in the depths of a great forest. The
officials had taken to the by-paths and scoured the
woods in search of them. Leaving their horses and
some of their heavier clothing, they trudged on foot,
skulking among the thickets. Their progress was
slow. One day they camped on a sort of a peninsula,
about half a mile from a church. They were
now thoroughly exhausted. Their diet had been
green corn, potatoes and watermelons for several
days, and they had been constantly on the move.
Here a stray calf came along and they shot it in the
head, but the calf did not fall, on the contrary, it ran
away. A small pig passed by their camp, and one
of them shot him in the head. But the pig refused
to succumb, and ran away.</p>

<p>After leaving their isolated camp in the evening,
foot-sore and worn out by reason of the anxiety and
fatigue, they pushed forward in a more southerly direction,
leaving Cleveland and the forest where they
had abandoned their horses to the right. At midnight
they had reached Marysburg, a small post village in
the southern part of Le Sueur county. Finding a
convenient hiding place they kindled a fire, and had
a meal of roasted potatoes and corn. The village
clock struck six. They heard the bell and judged
themselves to be about a mile from the town. They
left the Marysburg camp somewhat refreshed, and
with buoyant hope of an ultimate escape from impending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
peril. Thus far they had eluded their pursuers.
Their route from Marysburg lay southwestward
through Blue Earth county, to Mankato.
They made good headway during the day, and late
in the evening they found a nice hiding place in a
thicket in a cornfield, and lay very quiet without
making a fire. Twice during the night they were
alarmed by persons passing near them. Their hiding
place happened to be near a neighborhood path
which ran through the fields.</p>

<p>Six days after the affair at Northfield, when the
worn robbers were struggling along through a great
forest near Shaubut's, a few miles in a northeasterly
direction from Mankato, they came suddenly upon a
man named Dunning, who was one of a posse of
citizens in pursuit of them. They at once captured
this man, and a question arose as to the course to be
taken with him. At once it was suggested by some
one of the band to bind him fast to a tree and so
leave him. Dunning pleaded hard for his life, and
to be spared the terrible ordeal of such an uncertainty
as that of being left bound in that great forest.
It might be days before he would be discovered, and
it might be that no human being would pass that way
until he would be starved. Finally, from motives of
humanity, as they claim, they administered to Dunning
the most terrible oaths that he would not say
one word about having seen them until they had
ample time allowed to get out of the country altogether.
Dunning gladly consented to take upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
himself these solemn obligations, and they let him
go. The released citizen sought the haunts of men
and made haste to communicate to others all the
particulars of his adventure with the robbers in the
woods; and then the pursuit was renewed with new
ardor and zeal. At midnight, six days after Northfield,
the weary bandits trudged through Mankato in
a very different plight from that in which they had
made their entry into the place but a little more than
a week before. As they approached the town with
which they had made themselves familiar as they
went to Northfield, they were alarmed by the
shrill whistle of the oil mill. They concluded
that their approach had been noted, and the
steam whistle was the signal agreed upon to
call the citizens together in case the approach
of the robbers was noted. They therefore turned
aside from the main streets, and sought the lanes
and alleys back of the oil-mill. Here they hid
awhile, but as there did not seem to be any movement
among the citizens, they stealthily passed on,
across the bridge. The guards had retired, or were
not disposed to attack the six desperadoes. At any
rate, they were not interrupted. After crossing,
they raided a field of watermelons, selected four
large ones, and under the deep shade of the trees,
at the hour of one o'clock, they had a feast on the
melons. They visited a house near by and got one
spring chicken, and would have secured more had
time been allowed. But they heard a great shouting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
of people, and saw one man looking for tracks.
They fled at once up a bank, and pushed forward
through the woods bordering the Blue Earth river.
During the day they crossed that stream.</p>

<p>It was on the day after they passed Mankato that
Frank and Jesse James, who appeared to have suffered
less from the fatigue and exposure than the
others, bid a last adieu to their comrades in the ill-starred
Northfield enterprise. Only Cole Younger
and his brothers, Jim and Bob, and Clell Miller,
were left. The pursuers struck the trail of the
Jameses, and these desperadoes now had a terrible
time in eluding those who sought them. They were
repeatedly fired upon, and were both wounded
severely several times.</p>

<p>The four men left in the Blue Earth river forest
struggled on toward the west. They had passed
through the county of Blue Earth, and entered
Watonwan county, full seventy-five miles on a straight
line from Northfield, and a hundred and twenty-five
miles by the route they had travelled. They had
reached the swamps bordering the Watonwan river.
They had been now exposed to untold hardships
from the afternoon of the 7th of September to the
21st of the same month, a period of fourteen days.
They had subsisted on green corn, potatoes and
melons for the most part during that whole time.
They had had but little sleep, and had been constantly
harassed by their pursuers. For nine days
and nights they had been compelled to walk through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
forests and thickets, and their clothes had been literally
picked from their bodies by the thorns and
brambles through which they had struggled. Their
feet were in a most terrible condition. But their
pursuers still followed them with a grim resolve that
nothing could equal.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 21st, Sheriff McDonald,
of Sioux City, having tracked the brigands to a
swamp a few miles from Madelia, the county seat of
Watonwan county, Minnesota, the final struggle
commenced. The sheriff's forces had surrounded
the swamp where the brigands lay concealed. The
armed citizens then began to close in upon the surrounded
men, keeping up a continuous fire as they
advanced. The bandits were not the men to yield,
even to a superior force, without making a desperate
resistance.</p>

<p>One of the sheriff's men was severely and another
was slightly wounded as they closed in upon the
wearied but still determined men. The continuous
volleys poured into the thicket where the bandits
had concealed themselves were not without effect.
First, Clell Miller fell, moaned once, and then his
lips became mute forever. A heavy rifle ball then
crashed through Jim Younger's jaw, shattering the
lower jawbone in a most frightful manner. Cole
Younger received seven wounds, and Bob was shot
in the right elbow. They fought desperately, but
what could four men do? Sheriff McDonald commanded
a hundred and fifty courageous men, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
lives had been spent on the frontiers. Resistance
could no longer be offered, when one of their number
had fallen, and the other three were wounded,
two of them nigh unto death. It was the last struggle
of four as daring and dangerous men as ever
rode over the Western prairies. When resistance
had ceased, the sheriff's men gathered around them.
They were prisoners; their last hour of freedom had
expired. They were placed in spring-wagons and
carried into Madelia. The people of the whole surrounding
regions came flocking into the town to see
the renowned outlaws, for they had confessed that
they were the Younger Brothers, whose fame as daring
freebooters had already been extended over the
entire country.</p>

<p>In a few days the wounded robbers&mdash;Cole, Jim
and Bob Younger&mdash;were carried to Faribault, the
county seat of Rice county. They were closely
guarded, as well to prevent excited citizens taking
the law into their own hands as to insure the safe
custody of the bandits. The body of Clell Miller
was conveyed to St. Paul to be embalmed.</p>

<p>While confined at Faribault, the Youngers received
every attention, and rapidly recovered from
the effects of their long exposure and the terrible
wounds which they had received. During this time
a strong guard was maintained about their prison.</p>

<p>Early in October, the Rice County Circuit Court
met at Faribault, and Thomas Coleman, James and
Robert Ewing Younger were arraigned at the bar to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
plead to an indictment for murder in the first degree,
and for conspiring to commit murder and robbery.
Advised by counsel that under the laws of the state
the death penalty could not be inflicted in cases
when the parties charged entered the plea of guilty,
the three brothers plead guilty, and were sentenced
to the penitentiary at Stillwater for the terms of their
natural lives. A few days afterward they were removed
to their life-time place of abode, and the
stormy career of the Youngers closed. Since their
incarceration, it is understood that Jim Younger has
died. Cole and Bob, in their dreary isolation, still
survive, without hope of breathing the air of freedom
again.</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br />
<span class="small">ESCAPE OF FRANK AND JESSE JAMES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The most formidable band of robbers in this
country had suffered terribly in consequence of the
raid on Northfield. Charlie Pitts, Bill Chadwell and
Clell Miller&mdash;the last-named a formidable lawbreaker,
who was raised in Clay county&mdash;had lost
their lives. Cole, Jim and Bob Younger had been
captured. Jesse and Frank James were still free,
but numerous officers of the law were on their trail.</p>

<p>When the Jameses left the Youngers in the Blue
Earth river bottom, they were on foot. The Youngers
and Miller had entrusted to them their watches
and jewelry and most of their money, believing that
there was a possibility for the Jameses to escape.
The departure of Frank and Jesse created a diversion
in favor of the Youngers and Miller. The
bands of armed citizens followed the Jameses. For
two days and nights the brothers travelled westward,
their footsteps constantly dogged by wary
citizens. The hardships through which they were
passing were almost incredible. The men were
sometimes almost completely surrounded by the
citizens.</p>

<p>Three days after they had separated from their
comrades, they came to a wilderness region, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
the timber was heavy and the underbrush thick.
Here they proposed to rest for a season. But they
were tracked to their hiding place, and fired upon
by a band of pursuers. Frank James received a
wound in the hip. The brush was so thick that the
pursuers, who were on horseback, could make no
headway, and three of them dismounted to continue
the chase on foot. The direction taken by the
hunted men led to a swamp, but the season being
dry, there was but little mud in the basin. The
bushes were close together, and aquatic plants were
high. The three men seemed resolved to close up
with them. Several times the hunted bandits could
have killed the citizens, but for the fact that their
ammunition was giving out, and they desired to take
care of what remained for the last emergency. It
was getting late; the sun was low in the west, and
the shadows were deepening in the forest. The
three pursuers were determinedly following them.
Once or twice the hunted men were tempted to turn
and try the issues with their foes.</p>

<p>But they kept on. Just when daylight faded
away, they emerged from the swamp, and found
themselves in a travelled highway. They had lost
their determined foes in the darkness of the sombre
swamp behind them. They started down the road,
which lay along the bank of a stream of considerable
size. Wearied into a state of exhaustion, they
hoped to find a snug place where they could rest
and take some food. But their trials were not yet at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
an end. In the lonely depths of the forest, with the
dark, still river on one side, and the timbered wilderness
on the other, they heard the ominous sounds of
horses' hoofs. They listened. There were horsemen
behind and before them. In another moment,
sounds came from the woods, which indicated that
they were being surrounded.</p>

<p>The wearied freebooters quickly stepped into the
deep shadow of a great tree which stood upon the
bank of the stream, to await further developments.
That the horsemen were gradually closing around
them they were speedily convinced. Their situation
was critical. What could be done? The stream below
them was evidently deep and dangerous to ford.
Their plans were quickly formed and consummated.
They quietly dropped down the bank to the margin
of the stream, which at that place flowed close by
an abrupt bank. "They were there by that tree
but a moment ago," they heard one man remark, as
a party came up to the spot where the outlaws
had stood but a moment before. It was evident
that their numbers must exceed twenty. Stealthily
the hunted brothers moved down the stream along
the margin of the water, and close up under the
overhanging bank. They heard their pursuers discuss
the situation. "They are still near at hand, no
doubt," the brothers heard one remark. Then the
movements indicated that they were preparing for a
more careful examination of the situation where they
were. Soon several men came riding down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
road just over their heads. They had reached a
place where the river runs under a shelving bank
and the brothers could go no further without taking
to the water. Four men came down the bank
above, and came toward them. The brothers were
constrained to take to the stream. The water was
about two feet deep. They clung close to the bank,
and silently reached a place they deemed safe, in a
cave-like excavation made by the water under the
roots of a great tree. The hunters came to the
place where the bank and the waters met, and, apparently
satisfied, they turned and went back. The
brothers heard the clash of horses' feet on a bridge
below, and then they knew that the crossing below
was guarded. After a time all became still around
them. They concluded to swim or wade the river
from the point where they were, and, once on the
opposite side, to strike through the country.
Silently as possible, without any splashing, they
came from their place of concealment and waded
out into the stream until they were compelled to
swim. The night was quite dark, and they passed
over without being discovered. Climbing the opposite
bank, they found themselves in an open wood.
With all the haste which they could make, they proceeded
westward. A mile away they came to a
cornfield, and in the field there was a thicket. Here
they found a hiding-place, and, as wet as they were,
they partook of a repast of green corn, and lying
down on the grass, they slept soundly until the sun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
was up. Waiting some time in a sunny place until
their clothing had partly dried, the brothers started
on their weary way. All day they travelled without
being molested. In the evening, while travelling
along a country road, they met a man leading two
horses, one of which was saddled. They spoke to
him, and from his manner and the answers he made
them, they were convinced that he had not heard
anything about the affair at Northfield. They asked
him if he would like to sell the horses he was leading.
He answered that it was his business to deal
in horse-flesh. What would he take for the pair?
The man named the price, and, after some bantering,
a trade was effected, and even the saddle on
which he rode was transferred, the horse-trader declaring
that he did not own anything which he would
not sell.</p>

<p>Jesse and Frank James were once more mounted.
They stopped at a cabin in a lonely locality and
asked for supper. A woman and two children were
apparently the only inmates. They learned from
her that her husband had been summoned to help
catch a gang of horse-thieves, and had not been
home for three days. Frank carefully concealed his
wound, and the woman quickly prepared a good
supper for them, and, after settling with her, they
mounted and rode away.</p>

<p>The brothers rode all night, and as their horses
were fresh and good travellers, they traversed many
miles. They had already begun to congratulate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
themselves on their escape, when one day when they
were in the neighborhood of a town on the western
border of Iowa, they were fiercely attacked by seven
men, all well armed, but, fortunately for the outlaw
brothers, not very well mounted. A running fight
ensued, and Frank received a desperate wound.
But the good fortune which had so often attended
them came to their aid, and in the darkness of the
night they rode far away, and in the morning reached
a house where the services of a physician were secured,
who dressed Frank's wounds. The physician
was afterward arrested, but no evidence of his having
knowledge of the character of his patient was
produced, and he was discharged.</p>

<p>The brothers had reached the borders of Nebraska.
Jesse had a "friend" somewhere on the confines of
that state, and they proceeded to his place by easy
stages. Here they rested for some days while
Frank's wounds were attended to by a physician.
But the news of Northfield had reached there, and
suspicions of their friend and his strange guests
were aroused. It was deemed best to take an early
departure. An ambulance was procured. One of
the horses was disposed of, and the boys by easy
stages drove into Kansas. Their horse and ambulance
was disposed of there. At a station not a
thousand miles west of Kansas City they took the
cars, and were transported to Texas. At Waco,
Frank was placed under the care of a physician, and
nursed until restored to health again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
Thus was terminated one of the most remarkable
escapes from capture ever recorded. None other
than men of very superior genius could have succeeded.
As it is, the exploit is one of marvelous
adroitness, one which cannot fail to excite our
admiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER XL.<br />
<span class="small">A VISIT TO CARMEN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>After Northfield, Missouri was deemed an unsuitable
field for operations by the James Boys.
Nor did it afford a safe place of retirement for persons
who had engaged in such a desperate warfare
against the established order of society. But they
were accustomed to make long expeditions, and
they were at home anywhere. The shelter of a rock
sufficed for them in the wintry nights, and the
branches of a tree, with their spreading leaves, furnished
roof enough for them when the summer
nights came. Far away, in that region of the great
state of Texas known for many years as the Territory
of Bexar, where a beautiful stream flows down
from the rugged mountains toward the west, to unite
with the Rio Pecos, Jesse and Frank had established
a retreat which they called Rest Ranche. It is many
miles east of Fort Quitman, and a long way from
San Estevan. To the west there are rugged hills
and low mountains, covered with chaparral almost
impenetrable to man or beast. Far away in a
southern direction is the little frontier post called
Fort Lancaster. There are no frequented trails near
the place which they had selected. The Rio Grande
road, from Fort Quitman to Fort Lancaster, runs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
southwest of the rugged region alluded to above,
and the usual line of travel from Fort McKavitt to
the military posts and settlements on the Upper Rio
Grande, in New Mexico, was a long distance from
their chosen retreat. Toward the northeast are the
Salt Plains, and, further away still, the Staked
Plains, the dread of all travellers in those regions.</p>

<p>In this retreat they were free from the intrusion of
prying neighbors, and the inquisitiveness of passing
travellers. It was and is a lovely place. There are
few traces of the presence of man in that wilderness
land. The Pecos flows miles away from their place
through a valley full of natural beauties. But the
region is lonely&mdash;so lonely! There are only trails
occasionally followed by a band of predatory Lipans,
or traversed by marauding parties of Comanches and
Kickapoos, on raids to the Mexican border through
that vast region. It was in such a country the daring
bandits found repose; and, when occasion suited,
to ride untrammeled by fears.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">When the wild turmoil of this wearisome life,</div>

<div class="line">Oh, then there was freedom, and joy, and pride,</div>
<div class="line">Afar in the broad plains alone to ride!"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Such seasons of reflection concerning that which
is, and that which might have been, come to all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
mankind, and it came to the outlawed brothers, because
they are members of the great family. It was
doubtless at some such time, when their spirits were
subdued by their lonely communion with the grander
mysteries of nature, that the James Boys plead for
pardon of past offences, and promised future amendment
and conformity to the laws established for the
government of society. They have often manifested
a desire to be at peace with the world. But such
resting did not wait upon them.</p>

<p>Issuing from their retreat, they dared the danger
of the border, plunged through the chaparral,
ascended rugged mountain steeps, plunged down
their western slopes to the sand plains which border
the Rio Grande. Passing through the poor pueblo
of San Estevan, noted as the haunt of cattle raiders
and bandits; alarming the people at early morn by
their imperious behavior and skill as pistol-shooters,
exhibited by bringing down a chicken for their
breakfast at a distance of sixty paces, they rode
away to the Grande river, crossed over to the Mexican
side, and passed westward until the adobe walls
of Mojmia rose before and around them.</p>

<p>The brothers had grown weary of secluded living.
They had now started on an expedition destined to
create a profound sensation all along the border.
They passed on through Santa Rosa, and through
the desert lands, and over the mountains to the
westward of that place. These men never pause before
obstacles which would appall others. Neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
the rugged mountain passes where the Mexican
Guerrillas have their hiding places, nor the desolation
and terrors of "the Dead Man's Journey" arrested
their course.</p>

<p>Carmen is a village of considerable size and importance
in the northern part of the State of Chihuahua
in Mexico. Surrounded on three sides by
rugged hills rising into mountains, it is situated on a
line with an important pass through the Sierra Madres.
Carmen is therefore a halting place for caravans
of traders, and through its plaza passes treasure-conductas
from the mines of Chihuahua. The bold
riders from the north of the Rio Grande had an object
in going to Carmen, which was made plain in
due time.</p>

<p>Arrived at Carmen, Jesse and Frank, who had
been joined by three other members of the band at
Santa Rosa, among them Jack Bishop, put up at the
leading <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">posado</i> of the place. They were a well-behaved
company, and as they paid liberally for all
they desired, the people regarded them as a valuable
accession to the population. The boys had a
delicate way of demonstrating their capacity to
shoot, by killing a fowl, or pig, or dog, by shooting
it with a revolver from a great distance, taking care
always to make the exhibition as public as possible.
So it happened on this occasion. The Guerrillas
and other rough characters about Carmen had
a very respectful manner toward such persons. The
Mexican, whose pig had been shot, received four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
times its value and conceived thereafter a very ardent
affection for the American gentlemen of the
north.</p>

<p>It was in the late spring-time and the road through
Carmen was travelled by many traders and miners,
bound north through New Mexico, to the markets
of this country.</p>

<p>The adventurers from Rest Ranche noted
everything. There were little parties travelling together
with considerable money, on their way to
purchase supplies in the United States.</p>

<p>But it was not for such small profits that they proposed
to practice their profession. One day, six
pack mules, each loaded with 150 pounds of silver,
and each with a muleteer to control him, moved out
of the City of Chihuahua. With these rode twelve
men as a guard. They kept on until Carmen was
reached, without anything unusual happening. At
this place they halted for a day's rest. The outlaws
went among the guards, sought out the persons to
whose charge the treasures had been committed, and
ascertained the direction of their future movements.
Nay, further, they simulated fears of the lurking Indians
and plundering Guerrillas along the road before
them. They claimed to be anxious to get into the
United States, but had heard so many stories of the
dangers of the road that it had deterred them from
undertaking the journey. They professed to be
American gentlemen who had been looking over the
mines of Chihuahua. Their manners were affable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
and their story plausible. When they made overtures
to the chief of the conducta, to be allowed to
journey with the treasure party for mutual protection
across the dangerous border, their desires were acceded
to, and when the cavalcade moved slowly
away from Carmen the next day, the unsuspecting
merchants and treasure-bearers were accompanied
by five men of the most desperate character. For
the first three days of the march the Americans were
watched with some degree of vigilance, and the
Mexicans maintained a strict guard over the treasure-pouches.</p>

<p>But the deportment of the outlaws was such that
they soon succeeded in allaying any suspicion which
might have attached to them. Carmen was a long
way from the border, and the bandits did not care to
strike the blow which they had resolved upon when
too far away from their retreat, and that, too, on unfamiliar
ground. So they journeyed on with their
intended victims on the most amicable terms. A
suitable opportunity to seize the treasure was now
all that they wanted, for the Mexicans had grown
somewhat careless in consequence of their confidence
in the numbers of their party.</p>

<p>One day they halted by a crystal stream which
flowed down from a gorge in the mountains, and
where a spring of pure, cold water gushed from the
rocky bank. It was noon time, and the weary travellers
took the burdens from their beasts, and allowed
them to graze in the fresh, tall grass in the valley.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
It was a lovely day, and the scenery about them was
very charming. The muleteers and guards, all save
two, who stood sentinel over the treasure-pouches,
had thrown themselves on the verdant bank, and
were lazily conversing about the beauty of the situation;
the length of time yet required in which to
complete the journey before them, and like topics of
small interest to our readers. There were in the
company a Senor Molines, and another Mexican
gentleman, both merchants of Chihuahua. The
American desperadoes stood upon the bank under
the shade of a tree, a little apart from the group of
guards, who were in fact largely owners of the treasure
they watched. The muleteers formed a little
group not far away. The guns which the Mexicans
carried had been stacked, or rather leaned against a
tree. Mr. Molines and his friend sat smoking on a
moss-grown rock by the bank of the stream. It was
a picturesque scene, and the surroundings heightened
the effect of the picture.</p>

<p>The two guards on duty carried their guns carelessly
on their shoulders. Suddenly, Jesse James
called out,</p>

<p>"Let's go, boys!"</p>

<p>There was a sharp report of pistols. The two
armed guards sank quivering to the earth. The outlaws
rushed to the tree where the guards had left
their arms, and placed themselves with presented
revolvers between the guardians of the treasure and
their weapons. The two Mexican merchants were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
ordered to throw up their hands, and with the forcible
argument of leveled dragoon pistols, presented
as an alternative, they yielded, and one of the gang
went and disarmed them. The muleteers were paralyzed
with fear, and remained sprawled upon the
grass carpet. The place has been well named <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">La
Temido</i> (the place of fear.)</p>

<p>It had been but a minute since the first act in the
drama was presented, and in that time the whole
tragic play had been completed. What a revolution
in the circumstances of the actors had taken place?
Two were dead, and sixteen survivors were prisoners,
and at the mercy of five of the most desperate
men who ever played the part of freebooters on this
continent.</p>

<p>They took the horses of the merchants and
guards, broke their guns, forced the muleteers to
place the treasure pouches upon the best and
fleetest of the horses; shot the mules and other
horses not required, and threatened the frightened
men who were in their power with death,
and finally left them a long way from any human
habitation, without horses and without food,
and proceeded to the Rio Grande at an unfrequented
part of its course, many miles above Fort Quitman,
where they had provided a boat before they ventured
on their expedition, ferried the captured treasure
and swam their horses across, and in less than
twenty-four hours after their surprise and capture
of the treasures of the caravan, they had disappeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
in the rugged region which lies between the
Rio Grande and the Pecos, in the Territory of Bexar,
Texas. They had so completely hidden their trail
that all attempts to follow them were futile.</p>

<p>In a few days after this successful foray into Mexico,
Jesse and Frank were at their ranche enjoying
much-needed repose. How the members of the
wealthy party, with which they travelled from Carmen,
managed to get once more into the haunts of
civilized men, we have received no information.
The great heap of silver which they had taken was
brought by the outlaws into their retreat in the
mountains, and there divided among the five daring
brigands.</p>

<p>Why have the James Boys so many friends? Is it
because there are so many people disposed to lawlessness?
Are the friends of the Jameses, like themselves,
all outlaws? If they are not, why do they
yet sympathize with them? How can any honest
man succor and shelter them? Can it be possible
that any one can be so impervious to testimony as
to believe these men to be anything but outlaws?
These are the questions asked by those who believe
that the Boys ought to have been caught long ago,
and lay a large part of the blame for their escape
from arrest so long on the people of the states where
their most notable deeds have been committed.
Some persons point to the results obtained in Minnesota,
after Northfield, as an evidence that a large
part of the population in Missouri, Arkansas, Texas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
and Kentucky, where their most successful raids
have been made, must necessarily be in sympathy
with them, if, indeed, they are not in direct collusion
with the great outlaws. Such a charge is evidently
made by persons who have not examined into the circumstances
of the case, and the conditions which have
favored them in escaping apprehension by the officers
of the law. It will be remembered that the
James Boys have committed successful robberies in
both Iowa and Kansas, and it will not be claimed by
the most prejudiced mind that the people of Iowa
and Kansas, resident in the neighborhood where
these exploits were committed, were more in sympathy
with the marauders than were the people of
Northfield and vicinity. And yet the Jameses escaped
capture.</p>

<p>Without in any way assuming a defence of the
people of the states named above, on account of
their failure to capture the outlaws&mdash;for they need
no service of the kind from us&mdash;we may be permitted
in this place to state a few facts which may enable
cavilers to form a more rational judgment in this
matter.</p>

<p>That the Jameses have friends scattered through
many states we readily admit. That all those who
have a friendly feeling toward them are not in the
lower classes of roughs, is undeniable; that some
who move in respectable circles of society, and who
are above reproach, so far as their individual actions
are concerned, are yet disposed to apologize for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
them, is unfortunately true. But such "friends" as
these have nothing to do with obstructing the execution
of the law. The Jameses have numerous
friends in Missouri, Kentucky, Arkansas, Texas,
New Mexico and Colorado. And under like conditions
they would have equally as large a list of
friends in Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Dakota
and Wyoming. Their active, helpful friends
are to be found among that class which the law is
ever pursuing but never subduing. They are called
"thugs" in New York and all the other large cities;
and on the border everywhere, the same elements
in human nature which create "the thugs, pariahs
and roughs," of the urbane populations, produce
the desperadoes and road agents of the wilderness
regions.</p>

<p>Now the fact is, the Jameses have ranged over
the entire country, from the Ohio river to the shores
of the Gulf; from the borders of Iowa to the Sierra
Madres, and from the Blue Ridge to the Rocky
Mountains. Their reputation as daring men and
skillful leaders has made them known to all that
class of people who are without the pale of society,
as that term is applied&mdash;and there are members of
that class in every community&mdash;who at once seek an
alliance with such distinguished leaders of their
class&mdash;the outlaws. The result is, that these people
embrace every opportunity to serve such men as
Frank and Jesse James. Why has not Pinkerton,
with all his ability and resources as a catcher of lawbreakers,
caught these men?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
The answer is simple enough. They know the
country thoroughly; they have, not one, but many
places to which they can retreat, and when hard
pressed or sorely wounded, they go to their retreats,
where they are nursed and cared for until they choose
to go away.</p>

<p>Again, there may be, and doubtless are, a few
persons who have known the Boys from early childhood&mdash;knew
their father before them&mdash;and afterward
remembered the deeds performed by them in a cause
which they regarded as right, who are loth to believe
that the Boys are brigands and robbers. And
then it is certain that some of their "friends" are
persons who are free to admit that the Boys have
degenerated into lawless marauders, but excuse them
on the ground that they were driven to it by the terribly
bad treatment which they received at the
hands of those who were enemies of the Southern
cause in the struggle of long ago. It is barely possible
that a limited number of people, whose whole
mind and strength were devoted to the success of the
South during the great conflict, yet look back with
deep regret at the melancholy failure of their efforts,
and have apotheosized every man who engaged
on that side and fought for the cause which had become
sacred in their eyes&mdash;a very few persons who
belong to that class, representatives of which are to
be found everywhere, who can neither forgive nor
forget&mdash;who only remember that Frank and Jesse
James were fighters in that struggle, and hence all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
subsequent bad conduct cannot exclude them from
a place in their affections. This is in accordance
with the laws of human nature. All men are not cosmopolitan
in their views, and hence, when disasters fell
upon a cause which was believed to be right and sacred,
the little world in which these persons lived
and moved and had their being, suffered a moral
convulsion from which it has not yet recovered, and,
in their minds, can never recover.</p>

<p>With the social conditions and mental state which
enshrouded people like those described above, and
rendered them insensible to the requirements of social
order, we have nothing to do. Such people are
found in all climes now; and such people have lived
in all ages since the human family commenced the
struggle for existence.</p>

<p>But the "friends" of the Jameses are for the most
part persons who, like themselves, have rebelled
against the established order of society. They are
scattered all over the country, and among that class,
from the Rio Grande to the Ohio, the Boys have
personal acquaintances and active allies. Even beyond
the lofty range of the Rocky Mountains they
have confederates in spirit, if not in action. These
children of an ill-starred destiny roam over a vast
extent of country. And wherever they go, they are
likely to find some one who, from some cause or
other, open their houses to them and willingly
afford them succor and shelter. Some of these men
doubtless share with the renowned freebooters the
spoils gained in their daring profession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
The "friends" of the Jameses&mdash;even those who
are active allies and participators in their lawless
deeds, are many of them respected in the communities
where they belong. Among their neighbors
they are known as liberal-minded men of unquestionably
good character. Some of them have families
who are respected and honored by their associates.
Some of them, when at home, are regular in their
attendance at church, and liberal in their donations
for the support of the ministry. Some affect to patronize
the educational interests, while there are others
who are promoters of improvements in horticulture,
agriculture, and all other movements intended to benefit
the communities of which they are members. Who
would surmise that these staid and respected members
of society are leagued with outlaws? Generally,
their evil deeds are committed far away from their
places of residence. They are not often mixed up
in any affair near by, and when they join the band
for the purpose of committing depredations, they
always give out that they are about to make a journey
in a way directly contrary to that in which they
intend to travel.</p>

<p>But the most valuable of the members of the band
of friends of the Jameses are those who never go
abroad to depredate. They are of infinite service to
the Boys. In all their relations with their neighbors
and the members of the society with which they are
brought in contact, these allies of the brigands are
scrupulously exact and strictly upright. The consequence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
is, no suspicion attaches to their character,
and with them the outlaws are safe.</p>

<p>Not only do these "friends" not go abroad to
plunder, but when their confederates who "do the
work" commit a deed of outlawry in their vicinity,
they first conceal the robbers, and then turn out as
leaders of the hunters of the outlaws. They are sometimes
loudest in their execration of the plunderers, and
strongest in their expressions of hatred toward all lawless
men. Being good citizens of honorable repute, no
one suspects them, and their friends, the robbers, rest
until the storm has swept by, and then quietly they
ride away. Many of these men are well-to-do;
have good farms, live in comfortable houses, and
have many fine horses and fat cattle. Of course
these valuable allies have a liberal allowance of the
brigands' spoils set apart for their use and behoof.
It must be borne in mind that these men are residents
of regions of comparatively recent settlement,
where the antecedents of newly-arrived citizens are
not strictly inquired into by those who only arrived
yesterday themselves. So long, therefore, as the
citizen deports himself as "a clever man," so long
will his neighbors implicitly trust him.</p>

<p>Such is the character of the men which Jesse
James' fertile brain has called into service; the character
of the organization, which all the devices of
the shrewdest detectives, all the bravest executors
of the law have failed in ten long years
of effort, to disintegrate or destroy. The very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
fact that such an organization does exist, and that
Jesse James furnished the brains which summoned
it into existence, and has maintained it for so long a
time, stamps him as an extraordinary man&mdash;one
who, under other circumstances, might have become
a leader of men, and passed into history along with
George Cadoudal, Paoli, and other like actors on the
world's wide stage.</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER XLII.<br />
<span class="small">EXCURSIONS INTO MEXICO.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The wild, adventurous career of the boys has
been wonderful. They loved the road, loved to ride
at will over the land, and set at defiance the officers
of the law.</p>

<p>Nor have they confined their excursions to the
American side of the Rio Grande. Not unfrequently
they ride far away over the Sierra Madres into the
valley of the lakes; in Coahuila and San Luis Potosi,
they are known of many. In some of these
expeditions they pass through thrilling experiences
and innumerable dangers. Those border
rovers of Mexico who have crossed the path of the
boys once and have escaped with their lives, evince
no disposition to renew hostilities with the "gringo
devils," as they affectionately call the American outlaws.</p>

<p>In this chapter we propose to relate some of "the
hair breadth escapes" of the daring outlaws in the
land of the Otomis. These tales of wild life will not
fail to interest the reader.</p>

<p>One time&mdash;it was in the spring of 1877&mdash;Frank
and Jesse James rode down to the bank of the
"River of the North." Piedras Negras is a favorite
crossing place, both for Mexican cattle thieves and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
American outlaws. To this point came Frank and
Jesse James. The river was high and the crossing
difficult. It was not the season for successful raiding,
and the enterprising Mexican raiders had turned
their attention to the business of revolutionizing
their own country. In this pious undertaking they
had not met with that degree of success which justified
them in rejoicing. The lazaroni, gathered at
Piedras Negras, were particularly ill-humored, and
the lonely Texan who came in their way could expect
nothing better than to be plundered.</p>

<p>Such was the situation of affairs when Frank and
Jesse James arrived on the Texas side of the river
in front of the wretched Mexican pueblo. The
surly "greaser," who acted as the Charon at that
point, was even more surly than usual. But the boys
had passed that way before, and the ferryman had a
vivid recollection that one Estevan Sandoval, who
had molested them on one occasion, was now no
more in the land of the living. He complied with
the usual tedious alacrity of his countrymen to set
them across the stream.</p>

<p>There was an unusual number of ill-looking fellows
about the place, a fact which did not escape the
immediate attention of the boys. There were regular
brigands from the passes of the Sierra Madres;
thieves from Matamoras, cut-throats from Saltillo;
smugglers from all along the border, and rogues of
all grades. The boys knew there was "fun ahead."</p>

<p>It must be said to the credit of the Jameses that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
they neither seek nor run away from a fight. In this
case the character of the boys was sustained. They
proposed to pass on without stopping. In this benevolent
intention they were not destined to succeed.
Riding through the square, or plaza, as the Mexicans
call it, they passed on toward the country of woods
beyond. They had not got out of the straggling
village, when a mob of half-drunken, howling Mexicans,
mounted on horses, came after them, cursing
and firing off their pistols as they came. It would
have been well for some of them if they had never
beheld the face of a gringo. Doubtless the leaders
expected to see the boys use their spurs liberally
and make time out of town. In this they were disappointed.
The American outlaws were not accustomed
to flee before such "outfits." Instead of galloping
away, they deliberately halted, and the inevitable
pistols were drawn and "the fun began." The
Jameses do not have occasion to kill unless they desire
to do so, as they can easily disable an enemy
without taking his life. In less time than is required
to state the incident, four of the foremost of the rabble
were on the ground, with broken right arms.
The remainder of the crowd turned and rode with all
speed through the plaza. Actuated by some wild
impulse which sometimes seems to possess them, the
Jameses turned and rode back again to the square.
It came near proving a fatal ride to Frank. Some
of the Mexicans had taken refuge in an adobe house
on one side of the plaza, and seeing the daring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
American outlaws sitting on their horses in the very
midst of the place, in an attitude of defiance of all
"the brave men" of Piedras Negras, they mustered
courage to open fire upon the boys. A perfect
shower of bullets was discharged, and one of them
cut the brim of the hat worn by Frank James, narrowly
missing the side of his head. Then the boys
felt that they were in for "a good deal of fun," and
all scruple as to killing vanished. They shot to kill,
and death was the doom of any greaser who came
within their deadly range. Two were killed outright,
and then the ill-natured mob that had sought
to avenge the death of Estevan Sandoval, fled from
the village in terror, leaving the brothers in undisputed
possession of the place.</p>

<p>It was not their purpose to remain, and they rode
on in a short time. That evening, when they were
crossing a stream, swollen by the recent spring rains,
a party of brigands in ambush on the opposite
bank opened fire upon them, and Jesse received a
slight wound in the left shoulder. The boys charged
the thicket which had afforded the robbers shelter,
and the whole ten broke and fled, not however, before
one of their number was made to atone for the
hurt which Jesse had received.</p>

<p>This journey into San Luis Potosi, was one fraught
with many perils, and only the fate which seems to
protect them, enabled them to return into Texas.
They met with a singular adventure on this trip.</p>

<p>They had reached Monclova, a large town in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
Coahuila. Here they found an acquaintance&mdash;an
old comrade of the Guerrilla times. He had taken
up his residence in Mexico, had married a handsome
Mexican girl, and had settled down to a quiet life in
a strange land. Of course he was glad to see the
Boys whom he had not met since they parted in
Kentucky, when he was captured and sent to prison.
His home was placed at their disposal, and his Mexican
wife received them with that cordial hospitality
which is a characteristic of her countrywomen.
Here they proposed to remain a day or two and
rest.</p>

<p>In accordance with the customs of the country,
the Mexicanized American gave his old comrades a
reception on the following afternoon, or rather evening
after their arrival. A reception in Mexico means
a ball or <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">fandango</i>. Many of the leading citizens
of Monclova attended the reception, for the friend
of the Jameses was esteemed a very worthy citizen
and respectable gentleman.</p>

<p>Among the guests was a young lieutenant of the
Mexican army, and an American long resident in the
country, who came from the vicinity of Matehuala.
These two men scrutinized the faces of the Boys in
a very peculiar manner, and a careful observer could
have seen the flushes of anger which ever and anon
overspread their countenances. Jesse had noticed
their behavior, and called the attention of his brother
to the strangeness of their conduct. He was sure
that he had seen the American before somewhere,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
at some time, just when and where he could not remember.</p>

<p>Frank was enjoying himself in the society of a
fair senorita, and seemed to attach little importance
to his brother's suggestions. But Jesse watched
them closely, and became thoroughly convinced
that he had met both men before, and he knew that
the meeting had been that of enemies.</p>

<p>The lieutenant and his companion did not remain
long, but took their departure. There was at that time
encamped, in the environs of Monclova, a brigade of
the Mexican army, and the regiment to which the
lieutenant belonged had barracks near the plaza.
On leaving the ball-room, the two men went directly
to the headquarters of the regiment, and found there
the colonel and lieutenant-colonel. The young officer
at once laid before them the knowledge which
he possessed concerning the character of the men
who were being entertained in Monclova that night.
Both men had a score to settle with the Jameses.
The account of the American dated back to 1865&mdash;that
of the young officer only a little more than a
year, at which time, unfortunately, in one of the border
broils, frequent about that time between Mexicans
and Texans, the Boys had killed a brother of
the officer.</p>

<p>The superior officers looked with favor on the
scheme to arrest the Boys. The more readily, too,
did they agree to the plan of capture when informed
that the American authorities were offering a reward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
of $50,000 for the apprehension of these men. It
was a bonanza which the impecunious colonels hoped
to gain.</p>

<p>Silently as possible a company of eighty men
was mustered, and marched to the house, and immediately
surrounded it. The merry makers were
just in the midst of an evening of enjoyment. Indeed,
"there was a sound of revelry by night," and
the fair senoritas and chivalrous youths of Monclova
were animated by high hopes and dreams of future
bliss.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was an interruption. The doors
were thrown open, and an officer, accompanied by a
guard, strode into the room. The violinist dropped
his bow; the dancers stood still; the faces of women
blanched, and men quailed before this apparition of
war and bloodshed.</p>

<p>The officer stepped briskly to the part of the
room where the Jameses were standing, and addressing
them in broken English, commanded them to
surrender in the name and by the authority of the
government of Mexico. Frank and Jesse looked at
him with a disdainful, dangerous smile.</p>

<p>Would they surrender without his being under the
painful necessity of using force, inquired the officer.</p>

<p>"Never!" The answer was firmly delivered.</p>

<p>The officer turned to the guards, and gave a signal
of command for them to move up.</p>

<p>"Stop!" It was Jesse's voice of command. The
officer waved the guards to halt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
"We have a proposition to submit. Will you
hear it?"</p>

<p>"If it means surrender, yes," replied the officer.</p>

<p>"It is this:" pursued Jesse, not appearing to notice
the purport of the officer's reply, "allow these
ladies here to retire, and we will discuss the question
with you."</p>

<p>"I shall be compelled to take you by force," said
the officer.</p>

<p>"Let the ladies retire, I say!" exclaimed Jesse
James, in a tone that betrayed his impatience.</p>

<p>The Boys were not surprised without arms. They
never lay aside a pair of pistols. They are ever at
their sides, and always ready for use. The officer
parleyed. He did not desire to begin an affray in
the midst of a company of ladies&mdash;his instincts as a
gentleman revolted against subjecting them to alarm
and danger. The house was surrounded; he had
ample force to enforce the orders of his superiors;
so he said,</p>

<p>"Let the ladies all retire."</p>

<p>The order was given at the door to the guards to
to allow the ladies to pass through. The ball-room
was soon free from their presence. The men huddled
in one corner, and finally were permitted to retire
into another room.</p>

<p>"Now," said the officer, "lay down your pistols.
I have an ample force to enforce these orders. The
house is surrounded; you cannot get away."</p>

<p>The answer he received was a derisive peal of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
laughter. At the same moment a pistol flashed before
the eyes of the officer as he raised his sword to
signal his guard. He saw it but for an instant, there
was an explosion, and the officer fell dead to the
floor. The guard, amazed, rushed forward to succor
their fallen leader. They were thrown off their
guard. One, two, three deafening reports, and three
soldiers lay still, weltering in their gore. Celerity of
execution is safety, was ever the motto of the
Jameses. The guards who had followed their officer
into the house, fled when they saw their comrades
fall. The boys rushed out of the house. The soldiers
in the street met them with a volley of balls.
But they were too much agitated to shoot well. The
boys escaped with two or three trifling scratches.
They opened fire on the line of guards around the
house. Seized with consternation, the soldiers fled
from their deadly revolvers. The whole town was
excited. The streets began to teem with surging
throngs of men, women and children; the alarm
drums were beat in the barracks; the soldiers hastily
formed in line and marched to the scene of the disturbance.
Never had Monclova been so shaken
before.</p>

<p>It was too late. The cause of all the hubbub had
reached their horses, hastily saddled them, mounted,
and were then thundering far away through the dark
streets. They did not travel the highways after daylight
next morning. But they found a refuge in the
mountains, and when the excitement had subsided
they went their way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span></p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.<br />
<span class="small">DEATH TO BORDER BRIGANDS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The ranche of the James Boys furnished a temptation
to the Mexican border brigands, which they
were in no wise able to resist, even if they had possessed
the least particle of that moral sense which
enables men to withstand temptation. The Jameses
were successful rancheros; they lived out on the
confines of the white settlements in Texas. Their
fat herds spread over the valleys and ranged over
many hills. This wealth of cattle excited the cupidity
of the Mexican border banditti. They envied
the outlawed boys their goodly possessions; and
they were nerved to undertake to appropriate the
herds, even if the lives of the owners should be taken
in order to compass their wishes.</p>

<p>There was a robber chief of Nueva Leon, who
had once been a faithful lieutenant of Cortinas, "the
Robber Governor" of the State of Tamaulipas.
This fellow, whose name was Juan Fernando Palacios,
had achieved a local reputation about Piedras
Negras, Eagle Pass, Mier, and other localities on the
upper Rio Grande, as a daring freebooter and bloody
minded murderer. He had gathered about him a
band of men of like disposition with himself&mdash;principally
fugitives from justice from the neighboring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
states. This gang of desperadoes numbered more
than thirty men, and Palacios resolved to lead them
over among the ranches of the Texans. There was
much booty to be gained by a successful raid. It
was at a season of the year when many herds were
being pastured in the valley of the Pecos, and with
thirty men and more he fondly hoped that he could
come upon, and discomfit all the "cow boys" in
that region, and drive away the well conditioned
herds at his leisure.</p>

<p>It was in the autumn of 1877. The dry season
had withered the grass on the hill slopes and the upland
plains. But down in the valleys the grass was
green, and the wild flowers bloomed in all the freshness
of the spring time. Palacios and his brigands
made careful preparations before they set out. There
had been a season of quiet on the border. Several
months had passed since the last raid was made.
The Mexican brigand hoped to take the "cow boys"
unawares&mdash;surprise them&mdash;kill them, and drive away
their herds. This was his hope.</p>

<p>Mexican brigands are good night travellers. Indeed,
their most important movements are made in
the night. During the day time, if possible, they
take shelter in the chaparral, and remain quiet until
the shades of night fall over valley and plain, and
then under the starlight they ride&mdash;sometimes
accomplishing long journeys in a thinly inhabited
country without giving the least information of their
presence, so secretly do they move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
It was a lovely evening in October. There was
no moon, but the stars shone brightly from the cloudless
sky. El Paso was unusually quiet that evening.
There was not a fandango in progress in the place;
the sound of the violin was not heard within its borders.
The senoritas sang no vesper hymns. Palacios
and his robber band had gone across the river
into Texas, and not many young men remained in
El Paso. All night, beneath the silent stars, the
mongrel band of the bandit chief rode on toward
"the settlements" of the hated, as well as dreaded
Texans. Before dawn they found shelter in a patch
of chaparral in the valley of an affluent of the Rio
Pecos. No one had seen them. Thirty miles and
more they had ridden in the direction of the fat
herds of the Texans. The day passed away, and
once more the curtain of night fell, and the Mexican
raiders rode in its shadow. By dawn they had
reached the vicinity of a well stocked ranche. A
convenient shelter was sought and found near a little
stream. The raiders were many miles from El Paso
now, and the valleys and the hill slopes, and the
lower plains were dotted with great herds of cattle.
But the rancheros had not yet discovered the presence
of the enemy, and rested in fancied security.</p>

<p>An Alarmed "Cow-Boy."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Palacios and his band hovered near the herds all
day. Men were sent out to ascertain the number of
herdsmen attending the different droves. All this
time the horses of the raiders were carefully concealed
in a thicket by the bank of the stream. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
the evening came on, Palacios was well informed of
the locality of all the herds in his immediate neighborhood.
Dividing his men into two bands, over
one of which he appointed a notorious murderer
from Mier, named Jesus Almonte, and assumed command
of the other in person. The time appointed
for "the stampede" of the herds was ten o'clock at
night. At that hour the western herdsmen are almost
always sound asleep. Palacios was certain that
his presence on the American side of the Rio Grande
was not known. He had met no one, and his scouts
had reported everything quiet among the herdsmen.</p>

<p>Ten o'clock came. The Mexican robbers, well
armed and splendidly mounted, quietly left their
covert. Almonte and his band proceeded two and a
half or three miles up the stream where a large herd
of cattle were corraled. Palacios went down the
creek to "stampede" another herd of seven or eight
hundred head. The process of "stampeding" is
thoroughly understood by the Mexicans. The
herdsmen were aroused by the approaching horsemen.
But it was too late. The Mexicans were
among them, and Almonte's gang killed two of the
"cow-boys" at the upper herd, and Palacios' crowd
killed one at the lower herd. The "stampede" was
complete. The herds were turned toward the Rio
Grande, and driven rapidly away. All the remainder
of that night, and all the next day, the robbers
pressed forward toward their place of concealment
and shelter beyond the Rio Grande. As yet, no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
pursuers had appeared, but Palacios knew well that
they were not safe on this side the river. He knew
that the avengers were on his track, and he cared
not to see the face of a Texan at that time. Coming
at night time to the river some distance below El
Paso, he crossed over with all his booty, and speedily
made himself comfortable among his sympathizing
countrymen and countrywomen.</p>

<p>It chanced about that time that Frank and Jesse
James rode down toward the Rio Grande to make
observations, and enjoy life just beyond the borders
of civilization. Being somewhat in the outlaw business
themselves, they cared very little for "the borders
of civilization," or for that matter, for the interior.
While riding, they met one of the sorely disconsolate
herdsmen, who told the story which we have related,
with many embellishments; for instance, that a band
had come out of the south country, killed all the
herdsmen in the valley, driven off <em>all</em> the herds, and
that <em>he</em> only was left alive to tell of their fate.</p>

<p>To this doleful tale Frank and Jesse James gave
good heed, for one of the missing herds had been
their property.</p>

<p>The two brothers consulted together as to what
could be done under the circumstances. They had
been into Mexico on many occasions before, and,
although the frightened herdsman had magnified the
numbers of the raiders, so that they appeared a
mighty host, Frank and Jesse James were not the
men to submit tamely to downright robbery. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
brothers resolved to pursue the raiders. And so
they rode on and on until they came to the Rio
Grande.</p>

<p>It was in the early morning. The October sun
had not yet appeared above the horizon, but all the
eastern sky was refulgent with the coming glories of
a lovely day. Frank and Jesse James had ridden
far, but their horses were not jaded, and as for themselves,
physical endurance is their normal characteristic.
They were ready for any desperate adventure,
such as they were then engaged in. Only for
a moment did they pause when they emerged from
the river. Their fire-arms were carefully examined,
and then they urged their horses onward. El Paso
was silent. The inhabitants had not yet awakened
from their slumbers. Palacios and his band, with
their stolen herds, had passed on through the village
in the direction of the mountains. Their trail
through the sand was still fresh. The James Boys
rode on. Three miles away they came to the camp.
Deeming themselves safe, the Mexican raiders had
taken no precautions to guard against surprise. The
herds had been corraled, and the bandits, wearied by
their long marches, slumbered heavily.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_307.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>After the "Greasers."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Cautiously approaching the Mexican camp, the
two brothers, with that quick perception for which
they are distinguished, saw at a glance the situation
of the camp and the position of the sleeping robbers.
The dreamers were suddenly aroused by the
reports of the avengers' pistols. Jesse and Frank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
James were in their midst, and dealing death to the
miscreants ere they could grasp their weapons.
Some who dreamed were sent to their account before
the phantasy had cleared from their brains.
With a death-dealing pistol in each hand, they fired
with incredible rapidity, and at each discharge an
unfortunate wretch fell to rise no more. Terror-stricken,
the robbers fled in every direction. Some
were arrested in their flight by the unerring aim of
the outlawed brothers; and some more fortunate
escaped to the mountains with life only, everything
being left behind in order that they might save it.</p>

<p>The corral was broken up. The Boys are skillful
herdsmen, and soon the great tramping drove was
turned toward the Rio Grande. Ten dead robbers,
stark and still, among the cactus patches, testified
to the prowess of the American desperadoes. They
passed back through the village. Not a man was
visible. They had heard of the fate of their robber
friends. Terror-stricken, they had abandoned their
homes and fled into the chaparral beyond the hills,
which at this point approach the river. The Boys
were hungry after their morning's engagement, and
halting at the little adobe <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">posado</i>, they ordered
breakfast, taking care that it was prepared under
their personal supervision, in order that no treachery
on the part of their unwilling entertainers should
succeed.</p>

<p>The feat which they had accomplished was one of
the most daring ever recorded in the annals of border
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
strife. Then, the nonchalant way in which they ordered
the trembling inhabitants to minister to their
physical comfort, furnished another proof of the admirable
nerve of these remarkable men. After refreshing
themselves, the Boys, at their leisure, recrossed
the Rio Grande with nearly the whole number
of cattle which the bandits had driven away.</p>

<p>Desperadoes as they were, Palacios and Almonte
were indisposed to surrender the rich prize which
they had secured, as they thought, without any effort.
The two chiefs had stopped in the village the
night previous to the arrival of the Jameses, and
were not in the camp at the time of the attack of
the Boys. In El Paso, they lay hidden in a heap
of hay, while Frank and Jesse regaled themselves
with "the best the market afforded." The Mexicans
were convinced that a large force of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Gringo Diablos</i>
were at hand, and they feared for their lives. They
waited for the appearance of the squadrons of rangers
in vain. Gradually it began to dawn upon their
dull comprehension that the whole force of the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Gringos</i> numbered just two men. Palacios, Almonte,
and a few of their followers rallied some hours after
the Boys were on their march over the rolling plains
of Texas. They were furious, and boasted of what
great things they intended to accomplish. Sometime,
toward noon, they cautiously approached the
river, reconnoitered, and finally ventured to cross
over. There was no enemy in sight, and the twenty-five
brigands of the border became valiant, and set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
out on the trail of the Boys who were marching on
with the recaptured herds.</p>

<p>Encumbered as they were, by a vast drove of cattle,
their progress was slow. Toward evening the
Mexican bandits came in sight. But they did not
venture to attack. Hovering on the rear, and galloping
along the flanks of the moving herd, the
Mexicans made a thorough reconnaissance of the
force of Americans. There were just two men, and
no more. Emboldened by this knowledge, they approached
with a view of "stampeding" the herd.
Five well mounted men were sent to engage the
Boys while the others advanced on the left flank of
the herd. But they did not know the character of
the men they sought to kill out there on the plains.
Secured to the saddles which they bestrode, each
carried a long range sixteen shot Winchester rifle.
The bandits came within range. If they ever prayed,
the time for prayers had arrived. They were approaching,
unwittingly it may be, the margin of the
river of death; the black angel hovered over them,
the sun of time was being surely extinguished. Detaching
their deadly rifles from the fastenings, each
singled out his man, took deliberate aim, touched the
trigger, and instantaneously two Mexican robbers
fell to the earth pierced through their hearts. Their
comrades marked their fall, and knew the cause.
They turned to flee. It was too late. Even as they
turned two more of them fell, pierced through and
through by the unerring bullets from the steadily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
aimed rifles of the American outlaws. The other
one of the five fled, and succeeded in making his
escape.</p>

<p>The Boys fully comprehended the designs of the
Mexicans, and Jesse suggested that he would ride to
the summit of "the swell" to the left, to see what
"those other devils are about."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_311.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>Fight with Mexican Cattle Thieves.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Riding rapidly up the slope, his horse was soon
reined up on the crest of the ridge. There he discovered
on the slope below him a party of some
fifteen armed men. Bringing his rifle to bear, a
Mexican saddle was emptied in an instant. The
raiders replied; but their guns would not send a ball
so far. They were not less than four hundred yards
away. Jesse continued to empty saddles until four
men were down. The Mexicans turned and fled,
and Jesse gave them a parting salute, which brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
down a horse. When he rejoined his brother he remarked
sententiously, "Well, I've prepared a feast
for the vultures over yonder."</p>

<p>"How many are down?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"Oh, only four men and one horse," he answered,
with a grim sort of smile.</p>

<p>The dangerous time for them was the shadowy
hours. They knew that all the brigands of that region
would take their trail. They were a hundred
miles from any certain succor. The Mexican raiders
are not to be despised in a night affray. They
expected attack, and it is one of the peculiarities of
the Boys, that they never sleep when there is danger
surrounding them. The severe losses which they
had sustained only rendered the pursuers more wary;
but they still hovered around. The Boys expected
an attack that night. The sun was sinking low in
the west, and the brothers were earnestly consulting
as to the best means of guarding against the consequences
of a night attack.</p>

<p>"See," said Frank, "away there on that ridge
whose top the sun is gilding! Are those moving
objects men on horseback, or a herd of buffalo?
What do you think?"</p>

<p>The brothers halted. Since their removal to Texas
they never ride abroad without carrying with them a
field glass each. They now raised their glasses and
looked long and earnestly at the dark objects moving
between them and the horizon.</p>

<p>"They are mounted men," said Jesse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
"Texans, Mexicans, Lipans or Commanches?
Which do you say?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>Jesse looked again. The mounted men were
nearly two miles away&mdash;a long distance to determine
the character of men, or designate their nationality.
Long and carefully did he scrutinize the movements
of the horsemen.</p>

<p>"Soldiers&mdash;Federal soldiers&mdash;by Jehovah!" he exclaimed.
"Well, I've seen the time that I would not
like to see such a company, but I'm confounded glad
they've come around this evening. I'll get a nap to-night,
anyway."</p>

<p>It was agreed that Jesse should ride forward and
inform the officer in command of the presence of
Palacios' band of raiders. He spurred his horse
forward over the high rolling swells of prairie toward
the horsemen, who were also advancing. The Mexicans
saw this movement, and saw the horsemen.
They at once surmised that a detachment of McKenzie's
command was out looking for them, and turning
about, they rode hastily back the way they came.</p>

<p>The Boys were left in peace. The detachment of
cavalry swept onward in pursuit of the fleeing raiders,
and the herd, fatigued by long driving, were indisposed
to scatter. The return to the pastures
from whence they had been driven was leisurely
made. The Boys returned safely to their abode, and
Jesse was welcomed by one who worships him as the
world's noblest hero.</p>

<p>In the mellow days of September, 1877, a party
of seven men came to the neighborhood of Ogallala,
Nebraska, and went into camp there. They were
"stockmen," they said, and only wished to rest
awhile before entering upon the long, wearisome
march across the plains to Texas, which lay before
them. They had brought droves of cattle from the
pasture-prairies of the "Lone Star" state to supply
the markets of Chicago and other cities to the east,
and it was their intention, according to their statements,
to return to Texas to be in readiness for "the
spring drive." There was in this party Jim Berry,
of Portland, Callaway county, Missouri, an old-time
Guerrilla in the days of Anderson; Jack Davis, formerly
of the vicinity of Fort Smith, Arkansas, a
man of sinister reputation; Billy Heffridge, a Pennsylvanian
of no good repute; Jim Collins, a brother
of Brad, the well-known Texan desperado, who was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
killed in an encounter with a sheriff who attempted
his arrest, and Sam Bass, the somewhat distinguished
outlaw, whose name figures so prominently in the
criminal annals of the period between 1865 and
1878. There were two others, the identity of one of
whom has never been discovered. Of these, Berry,
Collins, Davis, and one other, had sometimes ridden
with Frank and Jesse James, and exchanged the
civilities of the craft with them. Who the seventh
man of the party of "campers at Ogallala" was,
the detectives have never been able to discover.</p>

<p>The "stockmen," as they styled themselves, remained
in camp near Ogallala for a number of days,
and were frequent visitors to the village. Jim Berry
had been in business at Plattsmouth, Nebraska, and
had made some acquaintances along the road.
Among the business men residing at Ogallala, which
is the county seat of Keith county, and a station of
some importance on the line of the Union Pacific
railway, was Mr. M. F. Leach, a gentleman of great
mental acuteness, and an excellent judge of men.</p>

<p>One day some of the "cattlemen" came to Leach's
store in Ogallala, among them Jim Berry, and purchased
a number of red bandana handkerchiefs. Of
course nothing was thought of the circumstance at
the time, but subsequently the red bandanas afforded
"a clue" to the identity of the robbers of a train on
the Union Pacific railroad.</p>

<p>Big Springs is a station on the railroad, about
twenty-three miles west of Ogallala, nearly on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
line between Keith and Cheyenne counties, Nebraska.
At this place there is an excellent supply
of water, which constitutes its greatest claim to importance,
for on other accounts Big Springs possesses
little to interest the traveller. One evening&mdash;it
was the 17th of September&mdash;the people of Brule
and Ogallala were thrown into a great ferment of
excitement on the arrival of the train from the West,
bringing, as the conductor and passengers did, a
full account of the great robbery of the express car,
and all the passengers, at Big Springs station, which
event had occurred just after nightfall that same
evening. It was a great sensation at the time, and
interest in it has not yet ceased to operate on the
public mind. A brief account of the robbery, and
pursuit and death of several of the robbers, will
not be regarded out of place in this volume, inasmuch
as some of the robbers had an acquaintance
with the principal characters who are the subjects of
this work.</p>

<p>The train from the Pacific slope arrived at Big
Springs on the evening of September 17th, 1877, a
little after nightfall. No sooner had the locomotive
come to a standstill at the little station, than a band
of seven men, all of whom wore red bandana handkerchiefs
on their heads, which fell over and concealed
their faces, sprang upon the train with drawn
revolvers. Four of the men guarded the engineer,
and entered the express car. Wells, Fargo &amp; Co.'s
safe contained $62,000 in gold. This was opened,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
and the contents taken out and deposited in a sack
which one of the robbers carried. Another one
kept guard over the train's crew, and two men,
well armed with heavy revolvers, went through the
train to take the purses, watches and jewelry of the
passengers. One of the fellows carried a sack, and
whenever the other handed him a watch, a pocketbook
or some jewelry, he thrust it into the receptacle
which he carried along. There were many
passengers, and they were on a long journey. Many
fine watches, much valuable jewelry, and innumerable
pocketbooks were collected in the sack, in a miscellaneous
heap. When the golden treasures of the
express safe, and the valuables of the passengers
were all secured, the brigands released the train and
rode away over the plains. The train then proceeded
eastward, by Brule and to Ogallala. The
particulars of the robbery were detailed, and the inhabitants
of those places were aroused by the intelligence.
It was late and nothing could be done that
night.</p>

<p>The next morning the "stockmen" were in camp
as usual, and Mr. Leach and some others of the inhabitants
of Ogallala were preparing to hunt the
robbers.</p>

<p>Mr. M. F. Leach had performed some amateur detective
work, and had exhibited so much acuteness
that he was regarded as one of the ablest catchers
of lawbreakers in the West. He was at once secured
to work up the great train robbery. To him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
is due the larger share of the credit for tracking
down the Big Springs bandits. And the men Leach
had to deal with were keen, adroit, and endowed
with extraordinary effrontery. We cannot enter
into detail concerning his remarkable pursuit of Sam
Bass and his companions, from Ogallala. A full
narrative would fill a volume. To show the character
of the men with whom he had to deal, we will
relate an anecdote of a meeting he had with Jim
Berry, one of the gang, the morning after the robbery.
As before stated, the "stockmen," who were
no other than the brigands, had returned to their
camp at Ogallala, and were there as if nothing had
happened, the morning after the robbery. Leach
was preparing to go after the robbers. He encountered
Jim Berry, who addressed him in a familiar
manner:</p>

<p>"Well, are you going out after those fellows?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Leach, "that's what I am going to
do."</p>

<p>"I wonder what they would give me to go along?
I might be of service to them."</p>

<p>"Well, I can say," said Leach, "that you would
certainly receive a liberal compensation for any service
you may be able to render."</p>

<p>The two men talked together some time, but Berry
did not go on the hunt for the train robbers. Mr.
Leach proceeded out the road to Sidney, in Cheyenne
county, not forgetting on his way to stop off at
Big Springs to find, if possible, some clue to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
robbers' course after leaving that place. He found
part of a red bandana handkerchief, which he secured,
and went on to Sidney in a special train which
had been provided for his use. A careful examination
of the situation in that place was barren of results,
and Mr. Leach returned to Ogallala. The
"stockmen" had remained in camp two days after
the robbery, and then they had marched away&mdash;whither&mdash;no
one knew. Leach had brought with
him the piece of red bandana from Big Springs. He
was sure the goods had come from his store in Ogallala.
While looking about the deserted camp of the
"stockmen," Leach discovered the other piece of the
bandana which he had brought from Big Springs.
The ragged edges of the two pieces fitted exactly.
The inevitable inference was that the "stockmen"
were the robbers. The direction taken by them was
not known, but Leach soon discovered their trail.
Then commenced one of the most remarkable pursuits
ever known. Leach ascertained that the robbers
would probably cross the Kansas Pacific railroad
at Buffalo Station, Gove county, Kansas. He
was ever on their track, and on many occasions he
escaped with his life in a marvelous manner. Once
he saw them count the spoils of the robbery, and
divide the money, watches and jewelry among themselves.
Then he sent a rancheman a long distance,
a hundred miles or more, with a dispatch to the
commandant at Fort Hayes to have a guard of soldiers
at Buffalo. The bandits divided into couples,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
and pursued their course. At Buffalo, some of the
robbers and the soldiers had a conflict, and Billy
Heffridge and Jim Collins were killed. Sam Bass,
Jack Davis and two others escaped. Jim Berry
made toward Missouri. It was ascertained that he
would probably return to Callaway county, and detectives
were at once hurried into that county and
quietly waited around Fulton and Portland for the
appearance of "the game."</p>

<p>One day Jim Berry made his appearance at Mexico,
in Audrain county, Missouri. It was known that
he had been in the Black Hills, and when he went to
the bank in Mexico with a large amount of gold
coin, principally twenty dollar pieces, to exchange
it for currency, the circumstance seems to have
aroused no suspicion at the time. Berry then "went
on a big bender." While in Mexico he had ordered
a suit of clothes from a tailor there. In a few days,
information was received by Sheriff Glascock that
Jim Berry was known to have been engaged in the
Big Springs robbery. Concerning this nothing was
said at the time, but the sheriff made all necessary
preparations, and patiently abided his time to make
an attempt to capture Jim Berry. One day, an old
comrade of Berry made his appearance in Mexico,
bearing an order on the tailor to "deliver to the
bearer" the new suit of clothes which had been ordered
by Berry. This fact was at once communicated
to Sheriff Glascock by the tailor. The friend of
Berry was seized, and persuaded in a manner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
frequently employed by officers of the law, to reveal
the whereabouts of his friend.</p>

<p>The friend of Berry was a man named Bose Kazy.
Sheriff Glascock and John Carter were in company
when Kazy was seized. The sheriff then called to
his aid John Coons, Robert Steele, and a young man
named Moore. They then set out, compelling Kazy
to act as a guide. It was on Saturday night, October
14, 1877, when the party rode quietly away
from Mexico, on their way to Callaway county, to
find the lurking-place of Jim Berry, "the best man
in Callaway." It was a long ride. Daylight had
not dawned on the landscape Sunday morning when
the officers arrived within a half-mile of Kazy's
house. They did not go to the house to alarm those
slumbering there. The officers took Kazy into the
woods and bound him to a tree, leaving Robert
Steele to guard him. They then secreted themselves
in thickets to await results. As the men
in the posse were assigned to their respective stations,
the sheriff gave the following command:</p>

<p>"Boys, if you see him, halt him; if he shows fight,
shoot him; if he runs, shoot him in the legs. Catch
him, at all hazards."</p>

<p>Half an hour after giving this order, Sheriff Glascock
heard the neigh of a horse about half a mile
away, as he judged. The sheriff and Moore then
crept cautiously about three hundred yards down
the course of a branch. They came to a fence, and
crossed over it. They discovered the tracks of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
horse, freshly made. They were in a thicket at this
time, and listening intently. In a few moments they
heard the snort of a horse, apparently not more than
fifty yards away. The sheriff then crawled through
the thicket about twenty yards toward the spot
from whence the sound had proceeded. He was on
his knees, and, cautiously peering through the
autumn-tinted leaves of the tangled thicket, he saw
the back of a horse, about forty yards away. Laying
aside his hat, Sheriff Glascock crept twenty
yards nearer. He then rose to his feet and saw Jim
Berry unhitching the horse, which had been tied to
a tree. Berry started to lead the horse in a direction
nearly toward Glascock. The sheriff cocked both
barrels of the breech-loading gun which he carried,
ran about twenty yards and within twenty feet of
Berry, and commanded him to halt. Berry, taken
by surprise, started on a run. The sheriff then fired.
The charge of buckshot passed over the head of the
train robber, but in an instant he fired again, and
this time seven buckshot took effect in Berry's left
leg, below the knee, and he fell to the ground.
Glascock sprang forward. Berry was endeavoring
to draw a pistol, as he lay writhing on the ground.
It was too late; the sheriff was upon him, and, seizing
the pistol, he wrested it from the grasp of Berry.
Finding himself overpowered, the wounded man, in
his helplessness, besought the sheriff to shoot him,
as he did not want to live any longer. The officer
told him that he did not want to kill him, but that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
he wanted him to have justice. By this time Moore
arrived on the scene. Berry was wounded and defenseless
in the hands of the officers of the law.</p>

<p>Sheriff Glascock then summoned the other members
of the posse to the scene of the conflict. When
they had arrived, Berry was searched. In a belt
worn on his person they found five $500 packages of
money, and in his pocketbook was found $304; in
all, $2,804 were secured. Berry also had a gold
watch and chain, a dress-coat, three overcoats and a
comforter. He had slept there in the thicket the
night before. Afterward, Berry was removed to
Kazy's house, and a messenger was sent to Williamsburg
for a surgeon.</p>

<p>After taking breakfast at Kazy's, Sheriff Glascock
and John Carter proceeded to Berry's house to
search for the balance of the money. Arriving
there, they asked Mrs. Berry concerning the whereabouts
of her husband. She did not know; had not
seen him for several days, and she thought he had
left the country. The sheriff then showed her Berry's
watch and chain. On seeing it, one of the little
children exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh! I thought that was papa's!"</p>

<p>Poor child! Perhaps it was too young to fully
comprehend the tragic meaning of those tokens.</p>

<p>To Mrs. Berry the whole story of the tragedy in
the thicket that Sunday morning was repeated. In
response, she said,</p>

<p>"I never thought he would be taken alive. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
has said a great many times that he would never be
taken alive."</p>

<p>Then ensued a scene deeply affecting. The robber
had those at home who loved him. The wife
and mother began to weep bitterly, and the wailings
of her little boy and five little girls, made a scene
calculated to touch the deep chords of emotion in the
breasts of the stern men, who in the performance of
lawful duty had been compelled to inflict all this
misery on the family of the robber.</p>

<p>They searched the house, but they found no
hoards of money. Then Glascock and Carter returned
to Kazy's, a conveyance was procured, and
the officer and his posse with their wounded prisoner
set out for Mexico, where they arrived late in the
evening. Berry was placed in a room in the Ringo
House, and received the attention of Dr. Russell, of
Mexico. Berry's wounds were painful, and he did
not rally from their effects. On Monday, gangrene
supervened, and a little before 1 o'clock Tuesday,
October 16th, 1877, Jim Berry, one of the robbers of
the train at Big Springs, quietly passed over the dark
river, and the records of his stormy career were
closed forever.</p>

<p>Sam Bass escaped from Buffalo station, and finally,
after many thrilling adventures, reached his haunts
in Texas. A little more than one year afterward
he met his fate in a manner equally as tragic as the
event which closed the career of Jim Berry.</p>

<p>Of the seven men who plundered the train and its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
passengers at Big Springs, Billy Heffridge, Jim Collins,
Jim Berry, Sam Bass, and one other, have met
violent deaths. The robber who went by the name
of Jack Davis has disappeared. The seventh man&mdash;the
only one whose name was never ascertained by
the detectives&mdash;succeeded in getting away. Who
he was, from whence he came, and whither he went,
are, until this day, unanswered questions.</p>

<p>Much speculation in regard to the identity of the
seventh man, whom we shall call the Unknown, has
been indulged in, and the question has been asked,
Was it Jesse James? or was it Jack Bishop, Dave
Pool, John Jarrette or Jim Cummings? We have
no means of answering such interrogatories. Whoever
the Unknown is or was, he has probably not a
single comrade of the occasion alive, and is therefore
in little danger of being betrayed.</p>

<p>There are people who believe that Jesse James
was with the Big Springs bandits. Upon what particular
grounds such belief is based, we have been
unable to ascertain. He may or may not have been
present. Our readers may well be left free to draw
their own inferences. But certain it is, a mystery,
which perhaps may forever remain such, surrounds
the personality of one of the daring raiders who accomplished
one of the greatest robberies which has
yet taken place on any American railroad.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>During the autumn of the year 1878, a young
gentleman of the highest respectability, a citizen of
the State of Georgia, being on a tour through
Texas, expressed to his friends a desire to make the
personal acquaintance of the celebrated outlaws,
Frank and Jesse James. His friends endeavored to
dissuade him from making the attempt to see them
at their own retreat. They represented to him that
such an undertaking would be fraught with no little
personal danger. The Boys have been hounded and
hunted over so large a territory, through so many
years, that they have become extremely cautious,
and very suspicious of all strangers.</p>

<p>But the young Georgian was courageous and determined.
There was a tinge of romance in his
composition, and the career of the Boys, to his
mind, was the most romantic in all history. He felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
that he would venture farther to see them than to
behold the face of any living man. The advice of
his friends fell unheeded upon his ear. He resolved
to seek their retreat at whatever hazard. He had
learned to admire their cool bravery, indomitable energy,
and shrewd ability to evade the snares laid for
them by the officers of the law.</p>

<p>The Jameses, outlaws as they are, do not want for
friends. They have devoted admirers and staunch
friends even in the ranks of respectable circles&mdash;persons
who would suffer death rather than betray
them. Such a friend was a Texas relative of the
young Georgian. Finding that his kinsman was resolved
upon a visit&mdash;that he would in all probability
be able to discover the retreat of the outlaws, and,
believing that he might possibly meet with a misfortune
by venturing to penetrate to their place, the
Texan gave his relative a letter addressed to a certain
name&mdash;which is not that of James&mdash;described
the route to be taken, and gave a minute description
of the personnel of the renowned desperadoes, and
with many admonitions and cautions, after having
solemnly pledged his kinsman to reveal nothing concerning
the exact whereabouts of their home, the
Texan bid his Georgia kinsman God-speed, and they
parted.</p>

<p>Many days he rode over the plains, and crossed
many a limpid stream, and pushed his way through
many a tangled wold before he approached the retreat
of the outlaws. He found it, however, but in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
what county or division of the state, he declines to
say.</p>

<p>In a letter written to the author, subsequent to
that visit, he gave a most interesting account of his
reception and sojourn with the outlawed brothers on
their own ranche. We have obtained his permission
to use that portion of the letter relating to the
Jameses, which we herewith present to our readers:</p>

<p>"It was a lovely afternoon. The grass was brown
and sere. A few late autumn flowers relieved the
otherwise monotonous landscape. The country
through which I was passing was high, undulating
prairie. Here and there, from the tops of the long
swells in the surface, the course of streams far away
to the right and the left, were well defined by dark
lines of trees from which the foliage had not yet
been cast. The journey had become lonely and
irksome. I had lost interest in the landscape. The
faded grass and the golden-hued flowers no longer
possessed charms for me. The limpid brooks and
darting minnows in their clear waters even failed to
awaken the slightest interest. The truth is, I was
worn out by the excessive fatigue of the long journey.</p>

<p>"I had just crossed a small stream, skirted by
some wind-twisted trees, and was ascending a long
slope. Looking toward the crest of the ridge, I
saw two horsemen, splendidly mounted, riding rapidly
directly toward me. They wore low-crowned,
broad-brimmed felt hats, looped up at the side. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
could see at a glance that they were heavily armed.
A repeating-rifle was swung behind the shoulder of
each, and a holster was attached at the saddle-bow.
When the horsemen had approached within seventy-five
yards of me, they suddenly halted, and each
drew a heavy pistol, and simultaneously presented
them at me, calling out at the same time for me to
raise my hands. I confess that I felt a little shaky
about that time. I readily complied with their
command, and held up both hands as high over my
head as possible. The horrible thought occurred to
me that I was to be shot, and left out there to make
a feast for voracious vultures and ferocious wolves.
A cold shudder thrilled through my veins. I had
dropped the reins, and my horse stopped still. It
was a dreadful moment. There were the two men,
grim in features and steady of hand, with their horrible,
yawning repeaters pointed at my heart. I felt
sure they were murderous highwaymen. Strange
that I never once thought of the renowned outlaws!
I know not how long I looked at those dreadful pistols;
it seemed half an age. I was aroused by the
voice of one of the men calling out,</p>

<p>"'Why don't you come on?'</p>

<p>"I did go on. Once I let my hands droop slightly,
as I advanced up the slope.</p>

<p>"'Up with your hands, I say!' exclaimed one of
them.</p>

<p>"You may readily suppose that I threw up my
hands without further admonition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
"When I had arrived within fifteen paces of the
spot where the men were sitting on their horses, the
thought that these were no other than the men
whom I was seeking, flashed through my brain.</p>

<p>"'What are you doing here?' asked the larger one
of the two.</p>

<p>"I must have stammered a little, and appeared
awkward and frightened as I made answer that I
had a great desire to meet Mr.&mdash;&mdash; and his
brother&mdash;naming the person to whom the letter was
addressed&mdash;and I have a message for Mr.&mdash;&mdash; here
with me now.</p>

<p>"One of them&mdash;it was Frank&mdash;turned to me
sharply, and asked me what I knew about Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;. I told him that I had never met the gentleman,
but that I had a great desire to do so. He
then asked me when I was last in St. Louis. I replied
that I had not been in St. Louis for a period of
more than five years. 'What are you doing here?'
he asked. 'Looking about the country,' I replied.
'You like it, do you?' he inquired. 'Very well,' I
said. 'You go to Chicago, do you?' 'Never was
there in my life,' I answered. 'Do you know Allan
Pinkerton?' 'I don't,' I said. 'What state do you
hail from?' 'Georgia.' 'A very good state,' he soliloquized.
'From whom did you say you had a
message for Mr.&mdash;&mdash;?' 'From Col.&mdash;&mdash;, of&mdash;&mdash;,'
I answered. 'You know where you can find&mdash;&mdash;?'
'I do not.' 'Give me the message; I'll see that he gets
it.' 'Are you Mr.&mdash;&mdash;?' 'No matter,' he answered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
'I'll see that he gets the communication.' 'But I've
come all the way here to see him myself. I do not want
to go back without seeing him,' I remarked. 'What
do you want to see him for?' 'Well,' I stammered,
'I have heard a great deal about him and his brother,
and I just wanted to visit them at home.' 'You
know who he is then?' 'Certainly, he is Jesse
James and&mdash;&mdash;.' 'An outlaw!' he interrupted me.
'Mind how you act, young man.' The tones of his
voice were dry and harsh, and the pistol which had
been allowed to droop was once more raised, and
pointed at my breast.</p>

<p>"You may be sure I was thoroughly alarmed, and
it required some effort to speak distinctly. At last
I managed to say in a tolerably low tone, 'I wish
you would read this letter which I have brought.'
The pistol was lowered and he reached out his hand
to take the letter from the breast-pocket of my coat.
Meanwhile, Frank kept me under cover of a pistol.
Jesse secured the letter, and commenced to read it.
I watched his features closely. A change came over
his countenance. The cold, stern look relaxed, and
his face put on a sunny smile as he read on. When
he had finished, he turned to Frank and said, 'I guess
this is all right.' Then he turned to me and said,
'So you are a kinsman of Colonel&mdash;&mdash;?' 'I am,' I
replied. He continued, 'He is a good friend of
ours, and I reckon you're all right. You wanted
to see the James Boys. You see before you what is
left of them. I guess you had better give us your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
pistols to keep for you until you are ready to leave
again, for you know we are the only armed men
allowed around our place. This is a very odd world
anyhow. We do not trust anyone.' 'I have but
one, and here it is,' I said, presenting it to him,
while I held the muzzle. He took the pistol and
thrust it into a side-pocket, and turning full toward
me, he said with a smile on his face, and a merry
twinkle in his bright blue eyes: 'So you wanted to
see the <em>notorious</em> outlaws?' 'Yes.' 'Well, did you
expect we wore horns, and had split feet, and spouted
fire and brimstone, eh? But you see you are mistaken.
There are a hundred, yes, a thousand, worse
men along the borders here than the James Boys.
But they have not been lied about as we have been;
they have not been hunted all over the states as we
have been; they have not been so grossly misrepresented
and abused, and we must bear not only our
sins, but the sins of many others. It is a pretty hard
fate, young man.' The hard, unpitying expression
came upon his features once more, but it was only
for a moment, and the cloud passed away, and his
countenance was illuminated by a smile that was
genial and pleasant, and whoever could have gazed
into the face of Jesse James at that moment, would
not have concluded that he was a desperado and an
outlaw.</p>

<p>"'I suppose,' said Frank, 'that you will accept an
outlaw's invitation to his humble retreat?' 'Most
gladly,' I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
"They turned their horses' heads, and Jesse taking
a position on one side and Frank on the other, we
rode on to the crest of the ridge. 'There is where
we camp,' said Frank, as he pointed away to the
northwest. Camp! Indeed, it seemed more like
the residence of a well-to-do planter in Georgia. The
situation which they had selected was beautiful as
any I had yet seen in the West. Before us a broad,
green valley lay spread out in the sunlight, bounded
by a line of high hills toward the northeast, and
widening toward the southwest. A noble grove of
timber skirted the margin of the stream, which appeared
to be of considerable size, and meandered
through the valley. Beyond the stream and the
grove, situated on a gentle slope in the midst of gardens
and cultivated fields, and vigorous young trees,
rose a pleasant house of two stories in elevation,
with a garden in front. Some distance away
were the barns, stables and other outbuildings. 'A
lovely home!' I exclaimed. Frank smiled at my
evident delight, and remarked that he found it very
comfortable, after the exposure and hardships
through which he had passed.</p>

<p>"So we rode on down the slope into the grove,
and across a beautiful broad pebble-bottom stream,
and up the slope to the front of the mansion, talking,
by the way, of many things in the past, and expressing
views and opinions concerning the future.</p>

<p>"The James Boys are far from being loquacious.
They seem to maintain a perpetual guard over their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
words. Sometimes this reserve is momentarily cast
aside, and the brothers will converse with considerable
freedom. But the fits of relaxation do not last
long. They speedily relapse into their accustomed
reticent state, and then they answer questions only in
monosyllables.</p>

<p>"It was not long before I discovered that I was at
the home of Frank James, and that Jesse and his
family were only visitors. My peculiar reception
was due to the fact that a person supposed to be a
detective, had been making inquiries concerning the
Boys at San Antonio, some weeks before my arrival.</p>

<p>"Arriving at the yard gate, we dismounted, and I
was invited into the house. At the door we were
met by a neatly dressed and handsome lady, whose
deep blue eyes and regular features produced a favorable
impression at once, to whom I was introduced.
It was Mrs. Frank James. She received
me with much dignity, yet with a genial cordiality
which assured me that I was a welcome visitor.
Her manner toward her husband was trusting and
affectionate. 'We welcome you,' said Frank, 'as a
relative of one of our best friends. We hope you
will prove as manly as he. Annie, this is Mr.&mdash;&mdash;,
a near relative of Colonel&mdash;&mdash;, who was so kind to
you when you arrived at&mdash;&mdash;, on your way out
here.' 'I am very, very glad to meet you. We all
feel extremely grateful to Col.&mdash;&mdash;, for his kindness
toward us, and we are only too glad to serve any of
his friends,' she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
"Such was the welcome which I received at the
home of Frank James. I felt myself quite at ease
very soon, and the four days and nights which I
spent under their hospitable roof gave no occasion
for me to think hard of the outlaws. Indeed, I
could not bring myself to think of them in that light.
Mrs. James is a lady who is suited by education and
disposition to grace any circle. And where is this
model home? you ask. Well, it is in Texas&mdash;just
what part of Texas I must leave you to find out. I
know that I never met with better treatment in any
home, anywhere."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVI.<br />
<span class="small">EPISTLES OF JESSE JAMES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Jesse James is not an educated man in the scholastic
sense of that term. In this respect he differs
widely from his brother Frank, who has a fair knowledge
of the Latin and Greek languages, and is said
to be able to converse fluently in the Spanish and
German tongues. Frank was a college student when
the war was commenced, and Jesse a school boy in a
country place. He had made some progress, had
learned to "read, write and cipher," and was wrestling
with "the knotty intricacies" of English Grammar
and Geography, when his career in school was
stopped short by the political events occurring about
him.</p>

<p>It cannot be expected that Jesse's literary performances
should exhibit the classic finish of an Addison
or an Irving, and yet barring his faulty orthography,
his style is direct and pointed, and under
other circumstances he might have become a very
good newspaper reporter. Although Jesse is deficient
in the command of language to express his
views in accordance with the canons of literary criticism,
yet his letters, if not elegant specimens of
composition, are at least vigorous and clear. It
is a matter of regret that so few specimens of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
epistolary ability are available. We have succeeded
in obtaining copies of a few of his letters, but unfortunately
none which reveal the domestic relations
and characteristics of the man. Such of Jesse's letters
as we have been able to secure, which have any
interest for the public, we present in this chapter.</p>

<p>The following note was addressed from Jesse to
"a friend" in Missouri, and came into the hands of
a gentleman who, for reasons which the author is
bound to respect, desires his name to be withheld.
The orthography alone is revised. The year, it will
be observed, is not given.</p>

<div class="blockquote2">
<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Commanche, Texas</span>, June 10th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jim</span>:</p>

<p><span class="j2">I</span> hear they are making a great fuss about old Dan Askew,
and say the James Boys done the killing. It's one of old
Pink's lies, circulated by his sneaks. I can prove that I was in Texas,
at Dallas, on the 12th of May, when the killing was done. Several
persons of the highest respectability know that I could not have been
in Clay county, Missouri, at that time. I might name a number who
could swear to this, whose words would be taken anywhere. It's my
opinion Askew was killed by Jack Ladd and some of Pinkerton's men.
But no meanness is ever done now but the James Boys must bear the
blame for it. This is like the balance of the lies they tell about me
and my brother. I wish you would correct the lies the Kansas City
papers have printed about the shooting of old Askew, and oblige,</p>

<p class="signature">Yours faithfully,<br />
<span class="smcap j4">Jesse</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>The date of the murder of Askew, given in the
above letter, is wrong. That event occurred on the
night of <em>April</em> 12th, and not <em>May</em>, as the writer of the
above note assumes.</p>

<hr class="c25" />

<p>The following is a characteristic note. It contains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
several allusions unintelligible to the uninitiated. It
was written to an old comrade, who long ago abandoned
a "wild life," and is living as a respectable
citizen.</p>

<div class="blockquote2">
<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Ft. Worth</span>, March 10th, 1877.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear</span> &mdash;&mdash;:</p>

<p><span class="j2">The</span> beeves will soon be ready. As soon as the roads
dry up, and the streams run down, we will <em>drive</em>. We expect
to take a good bunch of <em>cattle</em> in. You may look out. There
will be plenty of bellowing after the drive. Remember, it is business.
The range is good, I learn, between Sidney and Deadwood. We may
go to pasture somewhere in that region. You will hear of it. Tell
Sam to come to Honey Grove, Texas, before the 'drive season'
comes. There's money in the stock.</p>

<p>The following letter was obtained in Colorado, by
a gentleman who claims to be well acquainted with
the handwriting of Jesse James, and claims that it
was dropped by Jack Bishop. As to its authenticity,
we leave the reader to judge. It is in style much
such a letter as Jesse James might have written.</p>

<div class="blockquote2">
<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Rest Ranche, Texas</span>, January 23d.</p>

<p class="smcap">Dear Jack:</p>

<p><span class="j2">We</span> had a little fun on the other side of the line lately.
A lot of Greasers came over and broke up several ranches.
Some of us were down that way, and "the cow-boys" wanted us to
help them and we done it. Some of our cattle had been taken, and I
don't owe the yellow legs anything good anyhow. Well, we left some
half a dozen or more for carrion-bird meat. We brought the cattle
back. I was confounded glad we met some cavalry out after raiders.
There was a big lot of them motley scamps, and we would have had a
pretty rough time, I expect. But the sneaks got back as fast as they
could. You would have enjoyed the racket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
The last letter, to an individual, which we here
present, is vouched for as being in the handwriting
of Jesse James, by Marshal James Liggett. It was
written to George W. Shepherd about two weeks
after the Glendale train robbery. In this, as in the
other notes given above, we have revised the orthography,
without correcting the grammatical
errors. The letter is without date, and runs as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote2">
<p class="opening2"><span class="smcap">Friend George</span>:</p>

<p><span class="j2">I</span> can't wait for you here. I want you to meet me on
Rogues Island, and we will talk about that business we spoke
of. I would wait for you, but the boys wants to leave here.
Don't fail to come, and if we don't buy them cattle, I will come back

<p>On many occasions Jesse has written, or caused to
be written, exculpatory letters for publication in the
public journals. We present a few of these as specimens
of Jesse's epistolary style, and because of the
interesting character of their allusions to his own
conduct. It will be observed that the dates of outrages
on banks and railways, are wrong in several
instances, as given in these letters. For instance:</p>

<p>The following communication appeared in the
Nashville (Tenn.) <cite>Banner</cite>, of July 10th, 1875:</p>

<div class="blockquote2">
<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Ray Town, Mo.</span>, July 5th, 1875.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:</p>

<p><span class="j2">As</span> my attention has been called, recently, to the notice of
several sensational pieces copied from the Nashville <cite>Union and
American</cite>, stating that the Jameses and Youngers are in Kentucky,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
I ask space in your valuable paper to say a few words in my defence.
I would treat these reports with silent contempt, but I have many
friends in Kentucky and Nashville that I wish to know that these reports
are false and without foundation. I have never been out of Missouri
since the Amnesty Bill was introduced into the Missouri Legislature,
last March, asking for pardon for the James and Younger Boys.
I am in constant communication with Governor Hardin, Sheriff Groom,
of Clay county, Mo., and several other honorable county and state
officials, and there are hundreds of persons in Missouri who will swear
that I have not been in Kentucky. There are desperadoes roving
round in Kentucky, and it is probably very important for the officials
of Kentucky to be vigilant. If a robbery is committed in Kentucky
to-day, detective Bligh, of Louisville, would telegraph all over the
United States that the James and Younger Boys did it, just as he did
when the Columbia, Kentucky, bank was robbed, April 29th, 1872.
Old Bly, the Sherman bummer, who is keeping up all the sensational
reports in Kentucky, and if the truth was known, I am satisfied some
of the informers are concerned in many robberies charged to the James
and Younger Boys for ten years. The radical papers in Missouri and
other states have charged nearly every daring robbery in America to
the James and Younger Boys. It is enough for the northern papers to
persecute us without the papers of the south; the land we fought for
for four years, to save from Northern tyranny, to be persecuted by papers
claiming to be Democratic, is against reason. The people of the
south have only heard one side of the report. I will give a true history
of the lives of the James and Younger Boys to the <i>Banner</i> in the
future; or rather a sketch of our lives. We have not only been persecuted,
but on the night of the 25th of January, 1875, at the midnight
hour, nine Chicago assassins and Sherman bummers, led by Billy Pinkerton,
Jr., crept up to my mother's house and hurled a missile of war
(a 32-pound shell) in a room among innocent women and children,
murdering my eight year old brother and tearing my mother's right
arm off, and wounding several others of the family, and then firing the
house in seven places. The radical papers here in Missouri have repeatedly
charged the Russellville, Kentucky, bank robbery to the James
and Younger Boys, while it is well known, that on the day of the robbery,
March 20th, 1869, I was at the Chaplin Hotel in Chaplin, Nelson
county, Kentucky, which I can prove by Mr. Tom Marshall, the proprietor,
and fifty others; and on that day my brother Frank was at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
work on the Laponsu Ranche in San Luis Obispo county, California,
for J. D. P. Thompson, which can be proven by the sheriff of San Luis
Obispo county, and many others. Frank was in Kentucky the winter
previous to the robbery, but he left Alexander Sayer's, in Nelson county,
January 25th, 1868, and sailed from New York City, January the
16th, which the books of the United States mail line of steamers will
show. Probably I have written too much, and probably not enough,
but I hope to write much more to the <i>Banner</i> in the future. I will
close by sending my kindest regards to old Dr. Eve, and many thanks
to him for kindness to me when I was wounded and under his care.</p>

<p>The following communications appeared in the
Kansas City <cite>Times</cite> during the excitement succeeding
the great train robbery at Rocky Cut, near Otterville,
Missouri. The first one appeared in the <cite>Times</cite>
in its edition of August 14th, 1876, and the second
one came out on the morning of the 23d of the same
month.</p>

<p class="p4 center">JESSE JAMES' FIRST LETTER.</p>

<div class="blockquote2">
<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Oak Grove</span>, Kan., August 14, 1876.</p>

<p><span class="j2">You</span> have published Hobbs Kerry's confession, which makes it appear
that the Jameses and the Youngers were the Rocky Cut robbers.
If there was only one side to be told, it would probably be believed
by a good many people that Kerry has told the truth. But his so-called
confession is a well-built pack of lies from beginning to end.
I never heard of Hobbs Kerry, Charles Pitts and William Chadwell
until Kerry's arrest. I can prove my innocence by eight good, well-known
men of Jackson county, and show conclusively that I was not
at the train robbery. But at present I will only give the names of
two of those gentlemen to whom I will refer for proof.</p>

<p>Early on the morning after the train robbery east of Sedalia, I saw
the Hon. D. Gregg, of Jackson county, and talked with him for thirty
or forty minutes. I also saw and talked to Thomas Pitcher, of Jackson
county, the morning after the robbery. Those two men's oaths
cannot be impeached, so I refer the grand jury of Cooper county, Mo.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
and Gov. Hardin to those men before they act so rashly on the oath of
a liar, thief and robber.</p>

<p>Kerry knows that the Jameses and Youngers can't be taken alive,
and that is why he has put it on us. I have referred to Messrs.
Pitcher and Gregg because they are prominent men, and they know I am
innocent, and their word can't be disputed. I will write a long article
to you for the <i>Times</i>, and send it to you in a few days, showing
fully how Hobbs Kerry has lied. Hoping the <i>Times</i> will give me a
chance for a fair hearing and to vindicate myself through its columns,
I will close,</p>

<p class="p4 center">SECOND LETTER.</p>

<div class="blockquote2">
<p class="date"><span class="smcap">Safe Retreat</span>, Aug. 18, 1876.</p>

<p><span class="j2">I</span> have written a great many articles vindicating myself of the false
charges that have been brought against me. Detectives have been trying
for years to get positive proof against me for some criminal offense,
so that they could get a large reward offered for me, dead or alive;
and the same by Frank James and the Younger boys, but they have
been foiled on every turn, and they are fully convinced that we will
never be taken alive, and now they have fell on the deep-laid scheme
to get Hobbs Kerry to tell a pack of base lies. But, thank God, I am
yet a free man, and have got the power to defend myself against the
charge brought against me by Kerry, a notorious liar and poltroon. I
will give a full statement and prove his confession false.</p>

<p>Lie No. 1. He said a plot was laid by the Jameses and Youngers
to rob the Granby bank. I am reliably informed that there never was
a bank in Granby.</p>

<p>Lie No. 2. He said he met with Cole Younger and me at Mr.
Tyler's. If there is a man in Jackson county by that name, I am sure
that I am not acquainted with him.</p>

<p>Lie No. 3. He said Frank James was at Mr. Butler's, in Cass
county. I and Frank don't know any man in Cass county by that
name. I can prove my innocence by eight good citizens of Jackson
county, Mo., but I do not propose to give all their names at present.
If I did, those cut-throat detectives would find out where I am.</p>

<p>My opinion is that Bacon Montgomery, the scoundrel who murdered
Capt. A. J. Clements, December 13, 1866, is the instigator of all this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
Missouri Pacific affair. I believe he planned the robbery and got his
share of the money, and when he went out to look for the robbers he
led the pursuers off the robbers' trail. If the truth was half told about
Montgomery, it would make the world believe that Montgomery has no
equal, only the Bender family and the midnight assassins who murdered
my poor, helpless and innocent eight-year old brother, and shot
my mother's arm off; and I am of opinion he had a hand in that
dirty, cowardly work. The detectives are a brave lot of boys&mdash;charge
houses, break down doors and make the gray hairs stand up on the
heads of unarmed victims. Why don't President Grant have the soldiers
called in and send the detectives out on special trains after the
hostile Indians? A. M. Pinkerton's force, with hand-grenades, and
they will kill all the women and children, and as soon as the women
and children are killed it will stop the breed, and the warriors will die
out in a few years. I believe the railroad robbers will yet be sifted
down on some one at St. Louis or Sedalia putting up the job and
then trying to have it put on innocent men, as Kerry has done.</p>

<p>Hoping the <i>Times</i> will publish just as I have written, I will close.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVII.<br />
<span class="small">GLENDALE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The eastern part of Jackson county, the western
part of Lafayette, and down southward through Cass
county, constitute the very center of the field
of operation chosen by the old Guerrilla leaders&mdash;Quantrell,
Todd, Anderson, Younger, Pool, Clements,
and the Jameses&mdash;during the war. The Sni hills and
the timber-crowned undulations bordering the Big
Blue, afforded them excellent hiding places when
sorely pressed, and from their fastnesses in the hills
they could easily make forays into the very suburbs
of the garrisoned towns of Kansas City, Independence,
Lexington, Pleasant Hill and Harrisonville.
They knew every pathway over the hills, and every
crossing place along the streams. Around and
among these forests were the farms and dwellings of
their friends, and warm sympathizers in their cause.
Time has wrought some changes in the country since
those days; but the forest-crowned hills and the
deep, tangled thickets, and the sparkling streams
still are there. The face of Nature has changed but
little among the hills of the Sni, or along the banks
of the Blue. It was meet that the bandits, who are
believed to be the same men who once were Guerrillas,
should come back to the scenes of their earlier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
adventures, to consummate their latest and most daring
robbery.</p>

<p>October 7th, 1879, was a beautiful, sunny, warm
day. The woods had not yet assumed the sober
brown hues of autumn, but nature was lovely in the
rich ripeness of the summer's close. The great tide
of human life flowed on in its accustomed channels.
Some were engaged in the pursuit of pleasure;
some were in search of gain; others were toiling for
bread; some were happy in having accomplished
their designs; others were wretched in realizing the
bitterness of disappointment; some were glad in the
knowledge that they had contributed to the happiness
of their fellow-mortals; others were miserable
because they beheld the gladness of their neighbors,
and knew of the triumphs of their rivals; some
planned good deeds; others plotted dark crimes.
These all go to constitute the atoms of the mighty
tide of human life; and their plans, purposes and
deeds all contribute to the production of the surges
and swirls of the stream as it flows through time to
the gulf of eternity.</p>

<p>There were always plotters. Since the world began
men have schemed, and until the end of time
there will be the good and the bad in humanity,
sometimes one and sometimes the other quality predominating.
And so, while the autumn sunshine
was golden, and the wood-cricket's chirp was mournful,
the schemers were prodding their brain in the
devising of a scheme to commit a grievous crime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
Glendale is a lonely wayside station in the western
part of Lafayette county, Missouri, on the line of
the Chicago &amp; Alton railway, Kansas City branch.
There is a water-tank, a little station-house, and a
few houses in a narrow vale, wedged in between
rugged hills, which are covered with lofty trees and
tangled thickets, a fit place for the rendezvous of a
banditti.</p>

<p>Glendale is about twenty miles from Kansas City,
and on the line of the road between Independence
and Blue Springs, in the very midst of a region
where many of the darkest crimes and deeds of
blood which marked the Guerrilla warfare of the
border were committed both by the Federal militia
and the Confederate Guerrillas. The country about
Glendale is one of the wildest regions in Western
Missouri, and the hills and dark ravines afford excellent
opportunities for the concealment of both men
and horses. A better situation for a successful foray
by brigands does not exist on the line of the road
between Chicago and Kansas City.</p>

<p>The night express train, bound from Kansas City
to Chicago and St. Louis, left the Union Depot in
the first-named city on the evening of the 7th, at six
o'clock, and consequently was due at Glendale at
about seven o'clock&mdash;a short time after daylight had
faded from the west.</p>

<p>Now, as we have before intimated, Glendale is a
place with a nice name, but few inhabitants. Though
perhaps it is not destined to go down to history with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
the historic interest attached to Arbela, Malplaquet,
Shiloh, Kennesaw or Waterloo, yet so early in its history
Glendale has become famous. The incident
which contributed so much to this result occurred
on the evening of the 7th of October, 1879. In addition
to the station-house, the business of Glendale
is represented by a post-office and a general store,
kept by the postmaster. The evening in question
was very pleasant outside of houses, and when the
curtains of night were drawn, and the store was
lighted, the postmaster and four others, who constituted
the male population of the place, except the
station agent, Mr. McIntire, had gathered in front of
the little store to discuss the neighborhood's affairs.
They were quietly interchanging views. Suddenly
a stranger joined the circle, and, walking quickly to
where the proprietor was sitting, he tapped him on
the shoulder and said:</p>

<p>"I want you."</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked the other.</p>

<p>The new arrival did not deign to answer the question,
but quietly stepped away, and said:</p>

<p>"Here, boys."</p>

<p>In a minute&mdash;nay, a moment&mdash;half a dozen rough-looking
men, muffled and masked, stood by his side,
armed with huge pistols and wicked-looking knives.
Their pistols they held cocked in their hands. Then
the leader, in a harsh, grating voice, said:</p>

<p>"Now, take care, make tracks out of this!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
The terrified citizens started to obey. As they
were going, the leader said:</p>

<p>"To the depot, do you hear!"</p>

<p>In great consternation, the little company of citizens
filed away to the depot. In the depot was the
operator and agent, Mr. McIntire, and Mr. W. E.
Bridges, assistant auditor of the Chicago &amp; Alton
railway company, already under duress. When the
citizens were all assembled in the room, the leader
said:</p>

<p>"Now, sit down, act clever and keep still, or you
will not have heads left on you."</p>

<p>Of course, obedience to such an order was just
then regarded by all the parties as a great virtue, and
they therefore obeyed.</p>

<p>The masked men, who had now assembled to the
number of twelve, according to one account&mdash;fourteen
by another witness&mdash;tore away the telegraphic
instrument and went out and cut the wires. The instrument
was smashed.</p>

<p>"Now," said the leader, whose only mask was a
long dark beard, "I want you to lower that green
light!"</p>

<p>"But," said the agent, "the train will stop if I do."</p>

<p>"That's the alum! precisely what we want it to
do, my buck, and the sooner you obey orders the
better. I will give you a minute to lower the light,"
said the bearded leader, at the same time thrusting
a cocked pistol to the face of the agent.</p>

<p>The operator could see the long, bright barrel of
the pistol, and the dark, cavernous interior of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
tube had a forbidding appearance. He looked up
into the face of the long-bearded man. He saw a
cold, fixed look, and every indication, so far as features
could reveal intentions, that the robber chieftain
meant just what he said, and he lowered the
light. Of course the position of the light was an
order to the conductor to stop at Glendale and receive
fresh instructions, according to the code of signals
in use among railway men.</p>

<p>But to be perfectly sure of the expected plunder,
and in order to destroy even the possibility of the
train passing without making a stop, the robbers
heaped a pile of cross-ties, fence rails and other lumber
across the track. Having completed their preparations,
the robbers quietly awaited the coming of
the train.</p>

<p>It was a little after seven o'clock. The prisoners
in the station-house were wondering about what
would happen next, and especially were they concerned
and anxious respecting what should happen
to them. Then the distant rumbling of the train
was heard; louder and louder it fell upon the ears of
the listeners. The engineer saw the signal displayed
which commanded him to stop. He sounded the
whistle and ordered the brakes on. The train stood
still on the track, with the engine at the tank.</p>

<p>The conductor, with lantern in hand, sprang upon
the platform ere the wheels had ceased to revolve,
and was about to proceed to the little station-house
to receive his orders. But he had made little progress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
in that direction, when a man rushed up to him
with a cocked revolver, which he held out as if about
to fire. This man was speedily joined by another,
who was also armed in like manner. Both the men
wore masks. Mr. Greeman, the conductor, was of
course powerless to resist such odds, and with mingled
feelings of alarm and disgust was compelled to
await the pleasure of the strange men whom he now
knew to be robbers. Two men rushed up to the
cab of the locomotive and made prisoners of the engineer
and fireman by the presentation of pistols,
and the stern declaration that instant death would
certainly follow a failure to obey, or an attempt at
resistance. One of the robbers, addressing the engineer,
called out:</p>

<p>"Hand me that coal hammer of yours!"</p>

<p>"What do you want of it?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"Hand it here very quick, or you'll never have use
for another," was the emphatic command of the
robber, accompanied by a very significant movement
of the pistol arm.</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, the engineer obeyed. The
large hammer used by stokers to break coal was
handed to the masked desperado.</p>

<p>Then a group of the masked men, with the long-bearded
man at their head, gathered at the door of
the express car. One of the men with the coal-hammer
then commenced beating in the door of the
car. The messenger, who was in charge of
a large sum of money&mdash;more than $35,000 in currency,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
and much other valuable property&mdash;was inside,
but had refused to open the door. The messenger,
Mr. William Grimes, could hear the blows of
the ponderous hammer, and knew that his place
would soon be open to the marauders. The door
was already yielding&mdash;it was falling to splinters, and
a minute later the car was broken into by the masked
and armed robbers. Grimes, in the meanwhile, had
formed a hasty plan to escape with the money.
While the robbers were beating in the door, he
opened the safe, took therefrom a large amount of
money, hastily deposited it in a satchel, re-locked
the door of the safe, and was in the act of attempting
to escape by the other door.</p>

<p>He was too late. The robbers sprang into the car
before he was ready to leave it. In any event, escape
was rendered impossible by the fact that the
other door of the car was guarded. He could only
have escaped a part of the band to fall into the
hands of their comrades.</p>

<p>When the robbers rushed into the car, after having
broken the door open, one of them cried out to
the messenger:</p>

<p>"Here, you! Give me that key!"</p>

<p>"I will not. You may take it," answered the
messenger.</p>

<p>The words had no more than escaped his lips,
when one of the gang in the car dealt him a terrible
blow with the butt of a heavy revolver, which felled
him to the floor. They took the key, opened the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
safe, and rifled it of all its contents which were of
value to them. They then took the packages from
the messenger's satchel, and the great railway and
express robbery at Glendale was an accomplished
fact.</p>

<p>During the time occupied by a part of the robber
band about the express car, a patrol was distributed
along the sides of the train, and these were discharging
fire-arms at intervals, for the purpose, as is supposed,
of intimidating the passengers.</p>

<p>The whole time occupied in completing this great
robbery probably did not exceed ten minutes. The
whole amount of booty secured was probably fully
forty thousand dollars. The passengers were greatly
alarmed during these proceedings. Valuables were
hastily concealed under seats, about the persons of
the owners, and wherever else a place not likely to
be examined by the robbers could be found. After
concluding the work which brought them to Glendale,
the brigands, amid the reports of pistol shots,
set up a shout which echoed among the hills for a
long distance around, sought their horses, mounted,
and rode away through the gloom. They had locked
the citizens in the little station-house. These waited
until everything seemed still about the place, for the
train had moved on, and then they broke down the
door and walked out of their temporary prison-house.</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER XLVIII.<br />
<span class="small">HUNTING CLUES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>After the affair at Glendale, the marshal of Kansas
City, Major James Liggett, a cool-tempered,
clear-headed man, took charge of the case and
directed all movements intended to result in the discovery
of the robbers. It was soon ascertained
beyond a doubt that Jesse James had been in Kansas
City only a few days before the robbery. Then the
inquiry proceeded as to who else had probably been
participants. It came to the knowledge of the marshal
that Jim Cummings, Ed. Miller, and a hard
character named Blackamore, had been moving
about the country in a suspicious way. Little by
little, fragmentary scraps of information were secured,
and a generalization of all the facts led to the
general conclusion that the train robbery at Glendale
had been effected under the direction of the
James Boys; that certainly Jesse, and probably
Frank, had participated in it, and that Jim Cummings,
Ed. Miller and Blackamore were probable accomplices.</p>

<p>The next important point to gain, was information
concerning the route travelled by the bandits in
their retreat from the scene of their lawless depredation.
This was not so easy a task as the uninitiated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
might conclude. The character of much of the
country in western Missouri, with the thorough
knowledge of the region possessed by the principals
in the outrage, forbade an easy discovery of the
route which they had taken. But the marshal had
called about him men as well acquainted with the
country as any of Quantrell's old raiders could be,
and the little information gathered by each one, finally
brought together, led to the inference that they had
gone in a southerly direction toward the Indian Territory.
The inference afterward became a certainty.
Their "trail" was discovered.</p>

<p>Men were at once placed at various points on
their probable line of retreat; men were dispatched
on their trail to hunt them to their places of concealment.
There were men in western Missouri who
had ridden with the old Guerrilla band, bold, daring
men, who laid aside the weapons of destruction
when the war closed; men who had never learned
the meaning of the word fear, who yet became weary
of turmoil and strife, and settled down in life as
quiet citizens, who long ago ceased to sympathize
with their old comrades in their acts of outlawry,
and who, notwithstanding their peaceable demeanor,
were subjected to annoying suspicions at every recurrence
of the visitations of their former associates;
who felt when the train was robbed at Glendale that
it was time to take a positive stand on the side of the
law and to co-operate with the officers in every endeavor
to put an end to such depredations for all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
time by capturing the depredators. These persons
became active allies of Marshal Liggett in his efforts
against the bandits, and materially contributed to the
discovery of the robbers and the line which they had
chosen on their retreat. So the active campaign
began. There is reason to believe that after the
robbery was consummated, at least a part of the
band went into Clay county, and remained in seclusion
there for some days. Then they started south.</p>

<p>It was pending these events that Marshal Liggett
made an arrangement with George W. Shepherd,
formerly a Guerrilla captain, under whom Jesse
James served near the close of the war, to take part
in the campaign, then about to be prosecuted against
the bandits. As subsequent events have brought
Shepherd prominently before the public, and the
mystery which attaches to some of the proceedings
will continue to excite the interest of the public until
it is cleared up, it is deemed best to present a brief
history of the career of George W. Shepherd in this
connection.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIX.<br />

</div>

<p>The name of George W. Shepherd, which attained
prominence during the old Guerrilla times, when he
was one of Quantrell's most trusted lieutenants, had
passed out of the public mind, in a measure, until the
events following the Glendale train robbery once
more brought it prominently before the country.</p>

<p>At the time of the affair at Glendale, Shepherd
was following a peaceful avocation in Kansas City.
It was known to the marshal of that place,
and other officers of the law, that the relations
subsisting between the James Boys and Shepherd
had been rather unfriendly for several
years, and overtures were made looking to his
engaging in the pursuit of the outlaws. Shepherd's
reputation for desperate courage was not inferior
to that of any other man in the days when he led a
band of Quantrell's men, and when Marshal Liggett,
of Kansas City, had obtained his consent to engage
in the desperate undertaking, everyone expected
some sensational denouement. A history of the
Jameses, after the events which occurred since Glendale,
would be incomplete without some notice of
George W. Shepherd, the man who is credited with
engaging in a terrible conflict with Jesse W. James
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
and his followers, near Joplin, Missouri, resulting in
the alleged death of the outlaw, and in Shepherd's
receiving a severe wound in the left leg.</p>

<p>George W. Shepherd is a son of the late
James Shepherd, a respectable farmer of Jackson
county, Missouri. He was born near Independence,
January 17th, 1842, on a farm now belonging
to the Staten heirs. There were two
brothers older than George, namely, John and James
M., and one brother his junior, whose name was
William. J. M. Shepherd is now a respectable farmer
in Jackson county. During his boyhood, George
resided with his parents on the farm, and when of
sufficient age he attended the neighborhood school
for a few months every summer and winter until he
was able "to read, write and cipher," as he expressed
it. In early youth he manifested an adventurous
and somewhat wayward disposition. In 1857 he
left home and proceeded to Utah, where he joined
the army, at that time operating against the Mormons
under the command of General Albert Sydney
Johnston. The Shepherd family, which originally
came from Virginia, were a race of pioneers, and the
disposition of the subject of this notice to seek exciting
adventure on the borderland of civilization
was legitimately inherited.</p>

<p>After a varied experience, and absence of two
years, George returned to Missouri in the autumn of
1859, and resumed farming operations with his
brothers. He continued in this employment on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
farm about one mile and a half distant from Independence,
until the commencement of warlike preparations
in 1861. Seized by the prevailing military
fever, and his surroundings being all Southern, George
W. Shepherd was among the first to cast his lot with
the Confederate recruits. He enlisted in company
A, Captain Duncan's, of Rosser's regiment. This
command participated in the great battles fought at
Wilson's Creek and Pea Ridge, and engaged in many
other skirmishes in Missouri and Arkansas, in all of
which he took a part. When the Confederate army,
under the command of General Sterling Price, was
ordered to the east of the Mississippi, young Shepherd
returned to Jackson county, and soon afterward
joined Quantrell's command of Guerrillas.</p>

<p>The war record of Shepherd would fill a volume
if written out in full. For this we have not the space.
We can only summarize the chief events in this part
of his career. We first hear of George Shepherd in
a desperate charge made by Quantrell's men
on the garrison at Independence, in February,
1862. On that occasion he and a comrade, William
Gregg, swept down one of the streets of
Independence, causing the greatest consternation,
and inflicting no little damage on the soldiers of
Col. Burris' command. From that day forward
Shepherd took rank among the most daring of
Quantrell's men.</p>

<p>When Quantrell's small command of twenty men
was surrounded at night by a large Federal force,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
while asleep in the Tate house, near Santa Fe, Jackson
county, Missouri, in March 1862, Shepherd was
with the Guerrillas there, and was selected to guard
one of the doors of the house. The conflict which
ensued was terrible. After some minutes' fighting,
and when the house had been fired, the Federals desired
a parley with a view of inducing the Guerrillas
to surrender. Shepherd commanded the men who
defended the lower rooms of the house. He asked
for twenty minutes time. It could not be granted.
For ten minutes. No. For five minutes then. No,
if the Guerrillas did not yield within one minute, not
a man of them should escape, was the ultimatum of
the Federal officer. "Then count sixty," exclaimed
Shepherd, "and take the consequences." The fight
was renewed. That house had become a pandemonium.
In it were such men as Cole Younger,
Stephen Shores, John Jarrette, James Little, Hoy,
Haller, and others. The Federal commander permitted
Major Tate and his family to leave the house.
Then the fighting was resumed more fiercely than
before. The building was on fire. It was manifest
that the Guerrillas would be forced to evacuate
their fortress. It was resolved to break through the
Federal line. Quantrell led the desperate charge,
followed by George Shepherd, Jarrette, Younger,
Toler, Little, Hoy and others. Seventeen men made
the attempt, and succeeded in making their escape.
Three had surrendered before the attempt was
made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
Once, in the spring of 1862, George Shepherd,
Cole Younger and Oliver Shepherd were surrounded
at the house of John Shepherd, in Jackson county.
Their peril was imminent. The Federal force numbered
ten to their one. Cole Younger was about to
lead a desperate sortie, when Martin Shepherd,
Scott, Little and John Coger came up and attacked
the Federals in the rear. The diversion enabled the
Shepherds and Younger to escape from the house.</p>

<p>Soon after the incident noted above, George
Shepherd and Cole Younger were detailed to go
into Jackson county for the purpose of collecting
ammunition. They had collected a large amount of
the materials of war which were most needed in
Quantrell's command. One day they went to find
a wagon to convey the ammunition to camp. They
were at a house behind which was an orchard, and
this had been sown in rye which was now tall and
luxuriant. While at this house seventy-five Federal
troopers surrounded the place, and demanded their
surrender. They refused, and made a rush to the
rye-grown orchard ground, where they had hitched
their horses. Beyond the orchard was a skirt of
timber, now clothed in luxuriant green. They
gained the orchard in safety, although followed by a
storm of bullets. Mounting, they made a dash for
the forest. But they were not destined to reach it
unscathed. Three buckshot had penetrated the body
of Cole Younger, and George Shepherd was hit
hard and badly wounded. He, however, continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
his flight until he reached a shelter where he could
receive surgical attention.</p>

<p>It was about harvest time, 1862, that Major Peabody
undertook to capture Quantrell's band by a
vigorous movement with superior forces. The two
joined issue at Swearingen's place, a few miles from
Pleasant Hill, Cass county. A series of desperate
encounters followed. The Guerrillas were forced to
seek shelter in the woods. In the fights which ensued,
George Shepherd lost his horse. The Guerrillas
suffered fearfully, both in the neighborhood of
Swearingen's barn, and later in a depression near
Fred. Farmer's house. A number of Quantrell's
followers were seriously wounded. George Shepherd
had great difficulty in escaping from this sanguinary
engagement. He was again wounded,
though not severely.</p>

<p>Col. Upton Hayes, Col. Gideon Thompson and
Col. John T. Hughes, co-operating, resolved upon
attacking Independence, then garrisoned by a Federal
force of about five hundred men, under command
of Col. J. T. Buell, now of St. Louis. The Confederate
forces numbered about seven hundred.
Quantrell was requested to aid the enterprise, and
joined his forces with the regular Confederate troops
in an attack on Independence. George Shepherd
was there, and fought with desperate valor. After
the battle was over, when Quantrell was asked to
name the men of his command who had most distinguished
themselves for daring courage, George
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
Shepherd was designated as one among half a dozen
others.</p>

<p>In the early days of the autumn of 1862, George
Todd, commanding about fifty men, prepared an
ambuscade, with rifle pits, on the road leading from
Kansas City to Harrisonville. The place was admirably
selected, and the utmost caution and vigilance
was observed in guarding it, but it came near
being a slaughter-pen for the Guerrillas. One evening
he succeeded in destroying a wagon train, and
scattering the escort which accompanied it. But
sometime afterward, Gregg, Scott, Haller and Shepherd,
with a number of followers, re-occupied the
rifle pits. George Shepherd was sent out on the
road toward Harrisonville, south of the ambuscade.
It was, perhaps, past ten o'clock at night. The rifle
pits were still, and the droning hum of insects was
the only sound to break the silence. Shepherd was
motionless at his post down the road. Suddenly he
was made conscious of the presence of an enemy,
by a tall form which rose up at his right stirrup&mdash;a
form which had apparently come from the shadows
around him. But it was no apparition conjured up
by a disordered brain. The leveling of a gun barrel
at his breast, and the sharp utterance of the single
word, "Surrender!" convinced George Shepherd
that the form was very real. A glance satisfied him
that crouching forms were all about him, and all were
armed. He threw himself forward, shot the dismounted
trooper in the breast as he whirled his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
horse around, and received a scattering volley as he
dashed away to arouse his comrades in the rifle pits.
The Federal forces were under command of Major
Hubbard, a gallant officer of the Sixth Missouri
Cavalry. He had received full information about
Todd's rifle pits, had dismounted his command, and
but for Shepherd's extraordinary nerve and presence
of mind, he would have made a complete surprise of
the Guerrilla garrison. As it was, a terrible conflict
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
ensued, and a number of Federals were killed and
eight of the Guerrillas were wounded, among them
Shepherd, who received a slight flesh wound.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In August, 1863, Quantrell began to rally around
his standard all the small, detached bands in Western
Missouri for his expedition against Lawrence,
Kansas. At this time Shepherd was one of his confidential
advisers. In that grim council of war, summoned
by the Guerrilla chieftain to consider the feasibility
of engaging in such an enterprise, George
Shepherd sat among the stern, relentless warriors of
the border.</p>

<p>When Fletcher Taylor returned from Lawrence,
whither he had gone to obtain information concerning
the military situation there, and made his report
at Quantrell's headquarters to the assembled leaders,
the Chief spoke:</p>

<p>"You have heard the report. Before you decide,
you should know it all. The march to Lawrence is
a long one; in every little village there are soldiers.
We leave soldiers behind us; we march between garrisons
of soldiers; we attack a town guarded by soldiers;
we must retreat through swarms of armed men;
and when we would rest after such an exhaustive
march, we must do so with soldiers all about us, and
do the best we can. Come, speak out, somebody!
What is it, Shepherd?"</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, the answer came deliberately
and firmly from George Shepherd:</p>

<p>"Lawrence! I know the place of old. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
make no difference there between negroes and white
people. It is a Boston colony, and it should be
cleared out."</p>

<p>And the others gave similar replies, and so the
expedition, which was destined to be fraught with
consequences so baleful, was resolved upon. George
Shepherd went with the rest of the command, and
in the terrors and tragedies of that dreadful day, he
had his share.</p>

<p>The winter of 1863-4, Shepherd spent in Quantrell's
camp, in the vicinity of Sherman, Texas, leading
a comparatively inactive life; but the following
summer he was engaged in innumerable skirmishes.
At Pink Hill, in Johnson county, at Pleasant Hill,
at Keytesville, and many other places the fighting
was severe. Then came the mustering to aid General
Price. In that summer campaign the Guerrillas
took a conspicuous part. Toward the middle of
September, Bill Anderson was carrying destruction
to many neighborhoods in North Missouri. Todd
and Anderson combined, had a force of a little
more than two hundred men. In this troop rode
George Shepherd. He was present at Centralia.
The particulars of that dreadful day's work are given
in another place in this volume, and need not now
be recited. It may be accepted as a fact that
George Shepherd performed his part in that carnival
of Death.</p>

<p>Price and Shelby were compelled to retire from
Missouri. In a desperate encounter with the Federal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
advance, in pursuit of the retiring Confederate army,
Todd, who was protecting the rear, was killed.
George Shepherd succeeded him in the command,
and after lingering awhile in Missouri, he led the
remainder of the once formidable band of Guerrillas,
save about twenty men, who went with Quantrell
into Kentucky&mdash;to Texas. The forces under Shepherd
had fighting all the way. The Indians beset
their pathway and struck at them viciously as they
marched. Among those who went to Texas with
this force was Jesse James. In the following spring
the Guerrillas, or at least a part of them, returned.
The cause of the Confederacy had suffered. Lee
surrendered. Johnston followed. The catastrophe
came; the Confederacy was no more. Then the
Guerrillas of Missouri were permitted to go in and
surrender, and all save eight men of the band which
Shepherd had led back from Texas surrendered.
His career as a Guerrilla had ended, and Shepherd
went to Kentucky soon after the close of the war.</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>CHAPTER L.<br />
<span class="small">PURSUIT OF THE GLENDALE ROBBERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>During the days succeeding the robbery, the marshal
had learned sufficient to satisfy him that the
robbers had gone into retreat in Clay county; and
becoming aware of the fact that Shepherd was
working in Kansas City, the officer sought him out
and engaged him as a detective to assist him in the
pursuit. Shepherd consented, and it was arranged
that he should, in some way, place himself in communication
with the gang. The unfriendly relations
existing between Shepherd and the Jameses presented
a serious difficulty. The plan adopted to
overcome this was shrewdly devised. A story was
told, and industriously circulated, that it was a matter
of little doubt that George W. Shepherd was
engaged in the robbery, and that in consequence he
had fled to parts unknown. This was not all; Marshal
Liggett had printed on a slip of paper, already
printed on one side, an item to the effect that Shepherd
was believed to be implicated in the robbery.
It was reported to have been clipped from one of the
Kansas City papers. What follows in relation to
this enterprise is based upon the statements of Shepherd.
He relates that he went to Clay county, visited
the residence of Mrs. Samuels; saw that lady;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
told her a story about his persecution by the detectives
about the Glendale business; showed her the
pseudo newspaper clipping, and expressed a desire
to become a member of the gang; that he was blindfolded;
led a long way, and when relieved of his
eye bandages, he found himself in the midst of the
gang confronted by Jesse James; that his reception
was anything but pleasant, but that finally he was
able to convince them that he, like themselves, was
hunted; that he became cognizant of all their plans,
and then sought and obtained permission to go into
Kansas City after having taken a terrible oath to reveal
nothing and act true in every respect with the
band. He came into Kansas City, related all that he
had seen and heard to the marshal; was furnished a
fleet horse, pistols and blankets, and returned to the
gang. Liggett was informed by Shepherd that they
would leave Clay county at a certain time; that they
would cross near Sibley at a certain other time, and
would be at a certain place at a certain hour, where
he could see them if he so desired. Marshal Liggett,
acting upon this information, proceeded to the point
designated, and at the hour named he had the satisfaction
of seeing a party of armed men cross at the
previously announced place, and among them recognized
his chosen detective, Shepherd. The robbers
passed on southward. Rogue's Island is in the river
Marais des Cygnes, not far from Fort Scott. Here
the band camped one night. Their plan was to rob
the bank of Street &amp; McArthur at Short Creek,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
Kansas. This was to be effected on Sunday evening,
Nov. 2d, at 3 o'clock. When Shepherd arrived
in the camp on Shoal Creek, about nine miles southeast
of Short Creek, he exhibited his pseudo news
item to Jesse James, and in other ways succeeded in
convincing him that he was also an outlaw, and
Shepherd was thenceforward treated as "a man and
a brother." He states that the party consisted of
Jesse James, Jim Cummings, Ed. Miller, and Sam
Kaufman. It has been ascertained that the person
who was supposed to be Sam Kaufman was one
Blackamore. The plan to rob the bank was known
to the authorities, and contrary to the pre-arranged
measures for the capture of the outlaws, the guard of
armed men who were to have been in waiting at the
hour appointed for the raid, went on duty early in
the morning. Jesse James that morning went from
the Shoal Creek camp to Short Creek, and was in the
town when the guardsmen assumed their places,
and he noted everything. Of course this mistake
on the part of those engaged in the efforts to capture
them, caused a change in the plans of the gang.
Shepherd, well armed and mounted, rode to the camp
in the afternoon, after having been informed by Jesse
James of the situation at Short Creek in the morning
when they met. He found the brigands much alarmed,
preparing to break camp. Mike and Tom Cleary,
two of Shepherd's assistants, were to form an
ambuscade, but this part of the arrangement failed
because of the sudden movement of the band. Shepherd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
was to proceed to camp, provoke a quarrel
with Jesse, shoot him and flee, when of course the
other members of the gang would follow. But the
camp was broken up too soon. The ambushers
could not reach their place in time. Shepherd relates
that they were riding scattered out in the woods;
that he was riding near, and a little in the rear of
Jesse James; that he suddenly drew a pistol, called
out, "Damn you, Jesse James! thirteen years ago
you killed my cousin, Frank Shepherd." At the first
word Jesse wheeled his horse and sought his pistol.
He was too late. Shepherd fired, the ball taking
effect just behind the left ear, and Jesse James fell
heavily to the ground. After firing, Shepherd says
no one moved for a few seconds, when he, suddenly
realizing his position, wheeled his horse around, and
driving his spurs deep into the animal's flanks,
dashed away. At the same time Cummings rode
furiously toward him, while Miller went to the assistance
of the fallen chief. The pursuit of Cummings
was persistent and rapid. Blackamore soon fell
behind in the chase, but Cummings gained on Shepherd
until at last it became necessary for the latter
to make a stand and fight it out there. As he
wheeled his horse to carry out this resolution, a ball
from Cummings' pistol took effect in the calf of
Shepherd's left leg. The firing which had been
maintained during a chase of three miles, now became
quick and furious, and the result for a time
was doubtful. At last, Shepherd says, a ball took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
effect in Cummings' side, and he turned his horse and
rode back through the woods by the way they came.
Shepherd rode into Short Creek to have his wound
attended to.</p>

<p>The foregoing is Shepherd's account of his pursuit
of the Glendale robbers and contest with Jesse
James. But developments since do not sustain the
statements in many important particulars. The relation
appears to be correct up to the time of the
shooting, but it is now clear that he did not wound
Jesse James.</p>

<p>The truth is, that Jesse James was at all times suspicious
of Shepherd's motives, and from the time he
joined them he was watched with a ceaseless vigilance.
The outlaws had little confidence in his protestations,
and his movements were carefully observed.
They went into camp on Shoal Creek,
Shepherd being with them. According to their
custom they arranged to remove to another camping
place about three miles away the next day. It was
Saturday night, and Shepherd obtained the consent
of his ostensible confederates to go into Short
Creek. One of the brigands, assuming a disguise,
followed him for the purpose of watching his movements.</p>

<p>This man discovered that Shepherd was laying a
train for the capture of the band. During Sunday
morning, it appears Shepherd met Jesse James, who
informed him that "the game was up" in Short
Creek, and that they had been given away. Shepherd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
agreed in this view of the situation, and the two
separated. Later in the day Shepherd went to the
camp, where he had left them. It was deserted, but
he found their trail, and followed it to where the
new camp was established. The fact that it was not
the place which had been selected in Shepherd's
presence ought to have warned him that his situation
was one of extreme peril. But it appears that he did
not consider this evidence that he was distrusted,
and approached the camp. The moment he appeared
Jim Cummings opened fire upon him, and mounting
his horse gave chase. Both men were well mounted,
but Cummings' horse was the superior one of the
two. Shepherd, placing the reins of the bridle in his
teeth, and drawing two revolvers, the fight commenced.
He received a bullet wound in the calf
of his left leg, and in turn shot Cummings in the
right side, which fractured the sixth rib and wounded
the intercostal artery. Some fragments of clothing,
driven into the wound, arrested the flow of
blood from the artery, else the probabilities are that
the wound would have proved fatal. As it was, the
surgeon, who has furnished the above facts, removed
the foreign matter, took out some fragments of bone,
put a ligature on the artery, and in a short time the
wounded bandit went on his way.</p>

<p>It is asserted as a fact, that Jesse James was
neither wounded nor killed, but rode away a picture
of health and vitality. The peril of Shepherd was
imminent. Had he not wounded Cummings, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
desperado would soon have come up with him, when
the death of one or both of them would have been
inevitable.</p>

<p>The whole relation but confirms what has been
reiterated in the pages of this volume, that the resources
and shrewdness of Jesse James are truly
wonderful; that in all respects he and his brother
are men of extraordinary capacity, and that in courage,
skill, adroitness, and vitality, they are men
strangely endowed. What they may yet accomplish
is hidden in the unrevealed future, which to our
questioning returns no answer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LI.<br />
<span class="small">ALLEN PARMER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Allen Parmer is a Missourian. His boyhood
days were passed principally in Jackson county.
When the late war broke over the country, Allen
Parmer was a youth, little fitted to enter the ranks
with fighting men. Yet he became a member of
Quantrell's band. He first came into prominence
among his comrades in August, 1863, at the capture
and sack of Lawrence, Kansas. That day Parmer
was a member of the squad led by Bill Anderson,
who murdered without compunction and destroyed
without feeling. He escaped with the rest of the
band. He was at Independence; at Lone Jack; at
Camden; at Weston; in their lairs among the Sni
Hills, and along the waters of the Blues. He was
one of the six men who remained with Todd
at Judge Gray's house, near Bone Hill, Jackson
county, when Captain John Chestnut arrived in that
neighborhood, in September, 1864, bearing a communication
from General Price to the Guerrillas,
which at once caused a rally of the old partisans.
He was selected by Lieut. Geo. W. Shepherd as one
of the picked men ordered on a dangerous expedition
to the north side of the Missouri. The Guerrilla
campaign there was short but bloody. The terrible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
massacre and rout at Centralia was the crowning
event, and Parmer performed a conspicuous part in
that conflict. All through the operations of the
Guerrillas he was one of the most daring in the band.
He was one of the executioners of Bradley Bond, a
militiaman of Clay county. He and Frank James
captured the man, and afterward he was shot.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p><span class="smcap">Allen Parmer.</span></p>
<p>(Williams &amp; Thomson, Photographers, Kansas City, Mo.)</p>
</div></div>

<p>When Missouri no longer offered a field for operations,
and Quantrell entered upon his last campaign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
in Kentucky, Allen Parmer was one of the old Guerrillas
who followed him. The Federal garrison was
compelled to surrender at Hustonville, Lincoln
county, Kentucky. Thenceforward Quantrell was
known in his true character. In a fight in Jessamine
county, George Roberson and a member of Quantrell's
command, was captured, taken to Louisville,
and confined in prison, but subsequently escaped.
Afterward he was captured again, taken to Lexington,
transferred to Louisville once more, and there
arraigned before a court-martial, tried, convicted and
sentenced to be hanged on a charge of murdering
the Federal major at Hustonville, who fell by the
hand of Parmer. Roberson was afterward publicly
executed at Louisville.</p>

<p>Parmer took part in all the dreadful frays of Quantrell's
little band in Kentucky.</p>

<p>When peace once more brooded over the land, he
returned to Missouri, and commenced a commission
business in St. Louis, with J. W. Shawhan for a partner,
under the style of Shawhan &amp; Co. This was in
1866. It does not appear that the firm was very
successful. Parmer is said to have lost several
thousand dollars in this venture. Later, the business
was closed out. Payne Jones, and some others,
among them Jim White, a friend of Parmer, were implicated
in a bank robbery at Richmond, Mo. Mayor
Shaw was killed at that time. Suspicion attached
to Parmer as being one of the robbers, and he was
arrested, but, on examination, discharged. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
he led a sort of roving life for some years, sometimes
in Missouri, then in Texas, sometimes in Colorado,
then in the Indian Territory. Finally he
came to regard Texas as his home. In 1870 he returned
to Jackson county, where his boyhood had
been passed. For a long time his relations with the
James family had been friendly, and when he came
to woo Miss Susan James, the sister of Frank and
Jesse, she did not deny his suit, and they were married,
and removed to Arkansas the same year. He
remained in that state during the autumn and winter,
and in the spring of 1871 he removed with his
family to Texas. For a time, his wife taught a
school at Sherman. Subsequently, Parmer established
a ranche near Henriette, Clay county, Texas,
about 120 miles west of Sherman. Clay county lies
on the Red river, directly south of the Kiowa Indian
reservation. Here he had all the freedom he
desired, and for some years he tended his herds
and was prosperous. He frequently made trips to
Kansas City, St. Louis and Chicago with droves of
cattle.</p>

<p>When the train robbery at Glendale took place,
the authorities sought for clues to the robbers in
every direction. Mr. Grimes, the express messenger
who was knocked down by one of the robbers
who wore no mask, was able to give a vivid and
minute description of the features of his assailant,
and that description suited the personnel of Parmer.
Deputy Marshal Whig Keshlear was dispatched to
Texas by Marshal Liggett to effect Parmer's arrest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
He proceeded to Sherman, where he met and conferred
with Mr. Everhart, sheriff of Grayson county.
That officer readily consented to assist in the arrest
of Parmer, and proceeded at once to his
ranche, near Henriette. The officers effected the
arrest without difficulty on the 2d day of November,
1879, under a requisition from Governor Phelps, of
Missouri.</p>

<p>Parmer was taken by the officers to Sherman. He
was followed by a number of his friends from Clay
county. There the prisoner attempted to regain his
liberty by a writ of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</i>. But the judge
before whom the writ was returned ruled out testimony,
and remanded the prisoner to the custody of
the officers from Missouri, in obedience to the
requisition of the governor of that state. Parmer
took exceptions and appealed. Marshal Liggett,
however, had sworn out a warrant for his arrest before
a United States Commissioner, charging him
with interrupting the United States mail. But this
was unnecessary, for, on hearing the case, the state
authorities of Texas discharged the writ, and remanded
the prisoner again to the custody of the
Missouri officers, who at once set out for Kansas
City, where they arrived with their prisoner Sunday
morning, November 23d, and Parmer was promptly
incarcerated in the Jackson county jail. He emphatically
denied all complicity in the Glendale affair, or
any knowledge of the parties who accomplished the
robbery, and after four weeks' imprisonment he was
discharged by the Grand Jury, the authorities failing
to connect him, in any way, with the Glendale affair.</p>

<p>It required no ordinary sagacity to escape the
environments which his daring deeds had created
for him, after the robbery at Glendale. Had Jesse
James been other than a man of extraordinary
capacity in great emergencies, his career would have
been brought to an inglorious close before the clock
of Time would have indicated the commencement
of the New Year, 1880. But the destiny which
seems to guide him once more manifested itself, and
Jesse James, the bandit, rode through difficulties and
dangers, and away to repose and freedom on the far
off plains of Texas. There were many persons who
believed that the reported death of Jesse James was
true; that the account of the bloody duel between
George W. Shepherd and Jim Cummings, was confirmatory
of the statement of the former, that he had
shot Jesse James. It is probable after that fateful
Sunday in the deep recesses of a Southwest Missouri
forest, and the terrible peril to which he was there
subjected, that Shepherd really believed he had shot
Jesse. But, be that as it may, there were many
people who resolutely insisted upon it, that Jesse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
James rode away unscathed. Time has disclosed
the fact that they were correct. Several circumstances
combine to show that Jesse went away from
the vicinity of Short Creek, after the Cummings-Shepherd
conflict, in the enjoyment of perfect
health.</p>

<p>A few days after Christmas, the newspapers of
Kansas City announced the arrival in that city of
Mrs. Jesse James, from what point they did not say,
perhaps because they did not know. Mrs. James
visited relatives and friends in Kansas City for
several days, and her conduct was not at all like that
of a recently bereaved widow. After spending
some days pleasantly in the city, she proceeded with
Mrs. Dr. Samuels to the residence of that lady near
Kearney, Clay County, which fact was duly gazetted
in the society notes of the St. Louis and Kansas
City journals. Mrs. Samuels herself, though professing
to believe the reports concerning the death
of her son, yet did not act as though the conviction
had taken a very firm hold upon her mind. Mrs.
Jesse James remained some days at the residence of
her mother-in-law, and then suddenly she concluded
to visit her relatives and friends in Logan and Nelson
Counties, Kentucky. These movements of the supposed
widow of the late dreaded leader of the Glendale
robbers does not appear to have attracted any
great amount of attention from the officers of the
law. Indeed it appears Marshal Liggett had not
yet abandoned the opinion entertained by him, that
George W. Shepherd had shot and seriously if not
fatally wounded the noted outlaw,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
One day, after the middle of January, 1880, a
young man of respectability, residing in Kansas City,
who had been entrusted with a certain message to
deliver at Russellville, Ky., called upon another
young gentleman of his acquaintance, and invited
him to accompany the first-mentioned young man to
Kentucky. It was a mistake on the part of the
message bearer, for the young man was no admirer
of the methods of the chief of the Glendale band,
and, after revolving the proposition in his mind, he
came to the conclusion to acquaint Major Liggett
with the facts in his possession. This he did. The
marshal urged him to accept the invitation, and proceed
to Kentucky with his friend. It is intimated
that he supplied the necessary funds to enable the
young gentleman to make the journey. The two
men started. There lives in Kansas City a gentleman
who has known the James Boys, and who is not
their enemy, even now. This gentleman received
an intimation of what was going on, and learned
definitely the aims of the marshal. In half an hour
a message&mdash;it matters not what words were employed,
they were significant&mdash;was sent to Louisville,
to a friend. That friend received it, understood
it, and a message was at once sent to a person in
Russellville. Meanwhile, the conscientious young
man and his friend journeyed in the ordinary course
of travel toward Russellville. Arrived there, the
message-bearer cut his companion of the journey, and
the latter could learn nothing to report to the marshal
of Kansas City. The person to whom the message
came understood precisely what it meant, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
person whom Pinkerton and his employees have often
sought, once more found a quiet retreat, where he
cannot be readily discovered.</p>

<p>There are several stories afloat with regard to the
course taken by Jesse James after the Cummings-Shepherd
conflict. The following is understood to
be a correct narrative. Sunday night the party of
robbers separated, each man taking a route of his
own selection. Cummings was first cared for and
left in a secure place. Jesse James made a detour
toward the east, and then turned northward. He
remained in St. Clair county two days, and came into
Jackson county while the attention of everyone was
directed to the marshal's posse pushing down through
the Indian Territory to Texas. In Jackson county
he remained for some days, and when it suited his
convenience he proceeded to Texas by a route of his
own selection, without molestation. Afterward he
desired to enjoy a little civilized life and went to
Kentucky, where he was joined by Mrs. James.
But when the marshal's agent arrived in the region
he was not there.</p>

<p>Thus the great outlaw roves at will over the country,
and all the skill of men clothed with authority
to entrap him has for so long a time proved unequal
to the task. But it is said by those who are in a
position to know, that he longs to retire from the business
of an outlaw, make peace with society and
prove by an exemplary life in the future that his
nature is not wholly bad.</p>
